The Cubs and their manager have won nothing. <br/><br/>it may be that the Cubs win this series, but the game I watched that night featured two evenly matched teams who went at it head-to-head, the only difference being that the little bit of luck in that game went to the Cubs. this was only one game.<br/><br/>Do you know what a team gets for winning one National League Division Series game? Nothing. the Cubs need to win 2 more games after which they will advance to the National League Championship Series, which they will also have to win, before they get to a World Series. too many people are getting way ahead of themselves. If you don't believe that, take a look at how many times the best team in baseball has actually won a World Series in the last 20 years.<br/><br/>This is by no means a done deal, and the San Francisco Giants will have something to say about it, as will the Los Angeles Dodgers or Washington Nationals and whichever team when's the American League Championship.", "createDate": "1475965401", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1476110917", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 72969065, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20070427", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1476114517", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20070427, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
