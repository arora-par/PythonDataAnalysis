Cleveland in 1995 had a .700 winning percentage and lost.  In 2001 Seattle won 116 games.  There is a strange anomaly in sports that the best teams during the regular season often do not win the championship.  The Golden State Warriors were a truly great team this year and lost in terrific 7 game series to the Cleveland Cavaliers.  All that being said I like the Cubs this year.
