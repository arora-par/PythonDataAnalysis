I went to my first game in 1966 and saw them lose to the Pittsburgh Pirates.  I think the grandstand ticket I bought was about $1.25 -- certainly not much more.  Over the last 50 years I've seen them blow leads, choke in big games, sign disastrous free agents (remember Milton Bradley), fail to re-sign their stars (Greg Maddux!!!), raise our expectations, and dash our hopes.  But, I honestly believe this year is different.<br/><br/>We're gong to win it all.  I'm certain of it.
