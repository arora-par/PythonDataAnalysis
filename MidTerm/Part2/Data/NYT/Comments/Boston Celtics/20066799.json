He was still in the pacific in 1945 when they were last in one. He took me to my first cubs game in 1961 when I was 6. Sat behind a post, and cheered whenever my hero, Ernie Banks, came to the plate. Cubs swept the eventual NL pennant winners in a Sunday doubleheader. My brothers and I with friends would ride the El to Wrigley a dozen times per season whenever we could scrounge up a few dollars.", "createDate": "1475936286", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1475955053", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 66435282, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20066799", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1475958653", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20066799, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
