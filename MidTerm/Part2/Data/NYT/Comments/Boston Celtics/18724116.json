My small town Lions club bused us kids 70 miles so we could see a game against the Celtics with Bob Cousey.  Elgin Baylor was a Laker rookie and showed what the future would be--big men who could run the floor and do it all.  <br/><br/>I think the character of Coach Kundla was reflected in the personality of the old Lakers.  I don't recall a single team scandal.  But that was then and now things are much more complex.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the good times, Coach.
