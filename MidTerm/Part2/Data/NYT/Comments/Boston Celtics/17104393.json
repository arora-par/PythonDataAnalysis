I say this as a Celtics fan.<br/>However, Rondo's brutish behavior does not justify Morris accusing NBA players of being \"intolerant\" because they object to being forced to share a locker room with gay males who are sexually attracted to males. There are powerful reasons why society mandates separate rest rooms, locker rooms and other facilities for men and women - because of basic sexual differences. So why does this not apply to men who are sexually attracted to other men as well? That is not discrimination against gays - homophobia, but it does have implications for gays in situations such as locker rooms, in the close shared facilities of the army and elsewhere.  For society to not recognize and deal with this reality, this basic conflict, instead of imposing close contact of gay men on other males is itself a sexist attack on males. It is the mainstreaming of radical feminism. For a healthy society, this issue needs to be brought out of the closet and addressed.
