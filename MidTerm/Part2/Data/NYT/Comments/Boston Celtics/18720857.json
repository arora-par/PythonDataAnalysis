His son is a retired \"railway track worker\", he saves bingo winning vouchers to redeem for Hershey bars, cable is \"out of the budget\". How things have changed. Yes to all the calls for the NBA to get this man and his assisted living facility a big screen TV and all the NBA TV he wants to see. \"Jeez\" you'd have thought they would have done this long ago. I'd also like to see a Nike commercial featuring him alone in his wheelchair in an assisted living facility squeezed up to the TV screen watching a game with a voice over telling people after it's all over what's important in life.
