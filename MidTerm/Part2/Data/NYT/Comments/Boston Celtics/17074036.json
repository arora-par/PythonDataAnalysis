If I \"come out,\" I'm revealing a clear and inherent sexual orientation / preference / identity (not sure of the best word here).  If I \"self-identify,\" it is a linguistic act of naming; there is not necessarily a single \"core\" or \"truth\" that is being revealed.  Sure, the outcome can be the same, but it sounds like there's more flexibility for change over time in self-identification, because the self is not seen as a solid \"essence\" that can be unearthed and exposed.  Also, there's a layer of implication that I would \"come out\" to someone else, while I would \"self-identify\" (first) to myself, and anyone else who happens to hear about it is lucky though somehow irrelevant to the (f)act of self-identification.
