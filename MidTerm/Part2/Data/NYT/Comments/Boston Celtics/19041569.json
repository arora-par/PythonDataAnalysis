The Cavs do have a high luxury tax, but their new austerity may make is difficult for them even to make the playoffs next season.<br/><br/>Apparently, one championship is all the franchise wants during the Lebron Era", "createDate": "1467690856", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1467714743", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56679104, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "19041569", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1467718343", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 19041569, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
