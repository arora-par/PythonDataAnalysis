Let's be honest; the only reason he said anything is because he was \"called out\" in a terrible way on national tv which provided him the perfect platform to \"self- identify\".  So please, give me a break.  Put yourself out front first, before you're called out by a jerk like Rondo, and then the distinction between \"coming out\" and \"self- identifying\" might have some meaning.  Otherwise you're just making something out of nothing...
