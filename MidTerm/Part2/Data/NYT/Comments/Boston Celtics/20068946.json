I have found no equal to the joy of watching a game at Wrigley, despite the joy and disappointment of 1984. As a Chicago transplant to Dallas, my husband and I will have to have a split flag outside: the blue of the Rangers and the blue of the Cubs. But if the Cubs get to the series, you can bet, he'll be rootin' for the Cubbies. I only wish Mike Royko were still here to see it.", "createDate": "1475954856", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1475955152", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 57974316, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20068946", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1475958752", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20068946, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
