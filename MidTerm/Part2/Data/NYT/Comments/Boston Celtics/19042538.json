After jettisoning all kinds of people to make room for Durant, they have no size. And, not much money left over to go out and buy some. Call me crazy, but I for one do not think they are a shoe-in for the throne next year. Again, I'm a---much happier now than I was a week ago---Knick fan, so what do I know?", "createDate": "1467722966", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1467722225", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 68260775, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 19046608, "userLocation": "Oregon", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 19042538, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Michael", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Brian, you are NOT crazy. The Warrior line-up did not perform well the last three games of the finals. Like yourself, I don't see the addition of Durant solving the line-up problems revealed during those three games.<br/><br/>Of course, the solution might be sitting in plain sight--on the Warrior bench. Andre Iguodala, who has demonstrated the ability to shut down Le Bron James, was injured toward the end of the series. If a healthy Iguodala can repeat his 2015 treatment of James AND  Durant can fit neatly into the Warrior line-up, the Warriors might well be unbeatable.<br/><br/>But, I'm dubious. I'd feel better if the Warriors had a really good big man to clog the middle. And...one more Iguodala type player wouldn't hurt.", "createDate": "1467736901", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1467738675", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 64631470, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "19042538:19046608", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1467742275", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "brian morris", "commentID": 19046608, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 19050840, "userLocation": "Texas", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 19042538, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Metastasis", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "I agree, dropping Ezeli and Bogut leaves them without size.
