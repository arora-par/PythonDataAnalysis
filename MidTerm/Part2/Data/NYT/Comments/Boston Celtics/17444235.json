A life time Celtics fan, I find myself dropping everything to watch this team play, with their incessant dogging the opposition, with their steals and lightening passing.  Maybe I'm fantasizing, but one just gets the feeling that this is a bunch of guys who really like each other, who play more for each other's respect than anything else.  Like others, I lamented the loss of Perkins, later KG and Pierce, and then Rondo, but now I see the wisdom in Ainge's moves (won't say anything about David Lee).  <br/><br/>I recognize the need to add another player if they're going to make a run for the championship in a year or two, but I hope it is not at the cost of  the chemistry of the current team.", "createDate": "1454532837", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1454539856", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 39591892, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17444235", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454539856", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17444235, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
