In 2011 a trade concerning Chris Paul going to the Lakers was vetoed by commissioner David Stern. Stern felt the deal was to good for the Lakers due to their successful history even though the Lakers were on a downfall and their star players were growing old. With that being said, how was Kevin Durant allowed to go to The Golden State Warriors? The Warriors had just finished up a season with the best record in NBA history and have been to the NBA finals two years in a row. They have arguable the best shooter in NBA history in Stephen Curry, another outstanding shooter in Klay Thompson, and a great/stacked team with Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green just to name a few. Now with Kevin Durant added to the roster the Warriors should be known as \"The Big 5,\" which says a lot because that would just mean you have five all-star players on a team. The last team I've seen of this caliber was called the 2012 USA Olympic Basketball team.", "createDate": "1467835222", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1467834536", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 76026984, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 19067615, "userLocation": "wash., d.c.", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 19060521, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "joe kocur", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Good points, Troy.
