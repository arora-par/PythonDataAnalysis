He's been in the league for a number of years, he's had a serious injury.    He's really playing some of the best ball of his career.    The Warriors do a great job weaving him into the rotation to give their stars a rest.   He's a good change of pace.<br/><br/>Livingston's injuries were horrendous.   But he has good length and very good basketball acumen.    Shaun really keeps the Warriors' second unit humming along.   He's an outstanding bench player.", "createDate": "1462427177", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1462477041", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 65990911, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6599/0911/cropped-65990911.jpg?0.4266120859055117", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "18423130:18427665", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462480641", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "CRL", "commentID": 18427665, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "18423130", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462384880", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18423130, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": false}
