They don't want enlightenment, they want entertainment and fired up nationalism. They're more than happy that Establishment Republicans are staying away. The last thing they want to see is low energy speeches by the Bushes, or a loser like Romney, or a captured pseudo war hero like McCain.  Throw in some NASCAR champions, football idols, and  Trump loving celebrities  and add some patented Trump crowd response lines and the faithful will all go home energized just like at a revival meeting.. Trump will be in his glory strutting at the podium.  Actually bringing the Party together and having  coherent policy positions is secondary.  Trump's cult of personality, wherever it leads, has always been the defining message of this race.
