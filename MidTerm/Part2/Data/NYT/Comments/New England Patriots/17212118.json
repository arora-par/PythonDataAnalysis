Our quarterback was having an off-day, like all quarterbacks have, throwing inaccurately, but there is still his athletic ability to keep you watching and expecting.  When the snap went flying by Russell's head, I, like most Seahawks fans, thought to myself, \"this could be good\".

Here's a quick rundown of points allowed: Rams (34), Packers (27), Bengals (27), Panthers (27), Cardinals (39), Pittsburgh (30), Rams (23). In arguably one of their most important games of the season against Pittsburgh, Wilson torched the Steelers and pulled out a win despite the defense giving up 30 points. They have a great defense but they are vulnerable. The key this weekend is if Cam Newton can keep the dumb interceptions in check. If he does, the Panthers will win because it's doubtful Wilson will make stupid throws.", "createDate": "1452749355", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452792027", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 44490814, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17212118:17217407", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452792027", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "roseberry", "commentID": 17217407, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17212118", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452716929", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17212118, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": false}
