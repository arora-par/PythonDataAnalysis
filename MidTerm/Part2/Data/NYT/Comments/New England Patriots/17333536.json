I'll take Manning's \"60 seconds\" of mirror primping and priming any day of the week over Brady's numerous episodes of smug public sneering and obfuscating in his ugly attempt to divert attention away from himself and his team's varied instances of cheating scandals.  Spygate and deflategate are only two that we know of.  Probably more but hey,  who's counting.  The right teams are going to the Super Bowl.  For a change.
