I remained nervous throughout the game, half expecting them to do something stupid, like they did at Miami. Of course they were missing half their players in that game which I knew intellectually, but even so it's hard to watch bad football from the Pats  even though I for Belichik for the lousy game plan.<br/><br/>The last thing I would venture to do is to say they are going to go to the Super Bowl. In the words of the famous Bill Belichik, it's one game at a time and one play at a time.<br/><br/>They did play great though, and so did the Chiefs although time management is hardly their forte.", "createDate": "1453004995", "recommendations": 23, "updateDate": "1453005009", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 2073520, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/2073/520/cropped-2073520.jpg?0.18587254704312467", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17249219", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453005009", "trusted": 1, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17249219, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
