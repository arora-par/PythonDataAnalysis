Bjelland, Sr.", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "\"The one unifying feature of Western democracies today is the rise of nativist, nationalist parties. All of them tap a deep and thickening vein of pessimism about the economic and political prospects of the West. In part their ascent reflects the aftershocks of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, which shook the faith of many working-class and middle-class voters in the wisdom of liberal elites.\"<br/><br/>The rise of Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Jaroslaw Kaczynski in Poland and Donald Trump in the U.S.A. attest to the truth of the above claim.<br/><br/>If Trump were to be elected president, would he hand over the task of day to day governance to Mike Pence and some of Trump's other loyal supporters? Trump himself would then be free to cement relationships with such radical right-wing worthies as Le Pen, Orban and Kacsynski abroad, and to further the ambitions of his own Populist-No-Nothing version of the GOP here at home. <br/><br/>Wouldn't this strategy firm up a legacy wholly befitting the narcissistic, megalomaniacal Trump?<br/><br/>Of course such a turn of events could never transpire here. The American electorate is far too freedom-loving and reflectively democratic to ever permit the rise of an autocratic demagogue.", "createDate": "1478129429", "recommendations": 5, "updateDate": "1478206477", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 58063917, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20341155", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1478210077", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20341155, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
