Jim Tomsula was over his head from the moment his promotion was announced, as well as the majority of their current coordinators and position coaches. I'll be amazed if anyone with any talent or self-respect would consider coaching for the 49ers. It's become a franchise in free-fall, with an owner and GM who are too smug and clueless to turn things around and field a competitive team again.", "createDate": "1451927521", "recommendations": 18, "updateDate": "1451928248", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 779936, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17113014", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451928248", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17113014, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
