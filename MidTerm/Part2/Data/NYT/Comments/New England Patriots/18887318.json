If anti-Trumpsters convince themselves that the man has become toast, they may feel relieved of the obligation to vote for Hillary. But I would never under-estimate Trump. He is a showman first and foremost and can be counted upon to mount a flashy and glittery production for the convention. I am fearful he will entrance a good chunk of our TV-watching citizenry. Just as he conned so many with his 'university's' promise to make its students rich. While Hillary, with her focus on policy, will just bore the pants off those who tune in to the Democrats' convention.<br/>Right now, Trump is proving to be his own worst enemy. But I am certain that he could, by the same token, become his own best friend. Merely by saying less and bathing the convention hall with tons of Trump-branded tinsel.", "createDate": "1466311398", "recommendations": 292, "updateDate": "1466341523", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 54433458, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/5443/3458/cropped-54433458.jpg?0.3484913284086001", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18887318", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466311446", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18887318, "replyCount": 2, "editorsSelection": true}
