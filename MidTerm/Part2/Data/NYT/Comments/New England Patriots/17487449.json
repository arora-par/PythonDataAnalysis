We need gladiator sports and entertainment to distract us and numb our minds to our responsibilities and expenses for life, that we avoid and neglect everyday.  The billionaires will not be billionaires after the Huns crash our gates.<br/><br/>The Roman Empire was around for a long time.  It started as a modern democracy for its time, like ours. Devolved into an plutocracy with its wealthy and powerful, like ours.  Used its coliseums and gladiators to calm and entertain its citizens, like ours.  And ignored what was taking place as it left the world and its own citizens in worsening conditions, like ours.  So let the game begin, and forget about tomorrow.
