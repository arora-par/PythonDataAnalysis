Instead, the subject of \"hashed out\" is the noun \"series\".<br/><br/>Most people, when first reading that sentence, will assume that the word \"after\" is a preposition since it is closely followed by a noun (\"series\"), which is presumably its object, with no verb in sight. Only when the reader gets to the verb \"hashed out\" will he realize that something is wrong. That is why the sentence is so awkward. Only at that point will the reader, if he has the patience, go back and realize that \"after\" is actually a subordinating conjunction with \"series\" as the subject of the dependent clause.", "createDate": "1453836201", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1453838123", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 66389336, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17348904", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453838123", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17348904, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
