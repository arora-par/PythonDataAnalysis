I know what kind of abuse I had to endure, but they had to say it too my face or at least the people would tell me who said it and they would be confronted. Tt pains me to know that it hasn't moved on but  now with anonymous twitter and social media it is even more evil and scary (if that is possible).  My heart goes out to these journalists.  We need to learn respect for ourselves as  human beings. When \"role models\" like Trump and even a normally well spoken man like Bernie Sanders can say things about Hillary Clinton that are clearly from a sexist perspective we know we have a long way to go.  But we must keep on because the only other option is giving up and that is not an option.", "createDate": "1461843183", "recommendations": 436, "updateDate": "1461889318", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 35077296, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18359044", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461846374", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18359044, "replyCount": 5, "editorsSelection": true}
