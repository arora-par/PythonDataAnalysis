For example - just one example - you said that Brady, wasn't involved in in a climatic moment in a super bowl victory. Go back to the tape of the first one and watch Brady - with Madden in the broadcast booth imploring him to take a knee - get the team in field goal position. Not a minor role in the victory, in other words. Back to modern times:  They have a few guys on defense who can play and can be considered elite. Hightower, Malcolm Butler and Devin McCourty. Youngsters Malcolm Brown and Trey Flowers are on their way to stardom. And finally, they did play an elite quarterback recently: Joe Flacco. (Though off his peak.)  As for Hoge, go do your homework too: Roberts has been a great story this year and a simple Google search would have told you so.  (And check out the young players the pats drafted from the Chandler Jones deal.) Anyway, Happy New Year!", "createDate": "1482680767", "recommendations": 10, "updateDate": "1482686998", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 67080017, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20906767", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1482686998", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20906767, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
