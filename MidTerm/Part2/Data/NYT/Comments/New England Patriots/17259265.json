Spitzer", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "The Broncos were badly out coached. The Kubiak \"offense\" has been one step short of a disaster all year; and is deadly boring. Did Manning suddenly get old, or is Kubiak's concept of the offense just that bad? A good coach recognizes the talent of his players and designs the offense to fit their skills, not the other way around. By contrast Pittsburgh played with surprise and imagination on both sides of the ball. They almost stole the game. They just ran out of players, energy, and time.", "createDate": "1453129316", "recommendations": 8, "updateDate": "1453129329", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 63423891, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17259265", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453129329", "trusted": 1, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17259265, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
