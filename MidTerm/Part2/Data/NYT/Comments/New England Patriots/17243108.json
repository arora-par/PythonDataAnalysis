That said, well I don't want to be overly negative myself, I'm taking a dim view of their chances for today.<br/><br/>Teams that do well  are those that have peaked in December and are playing their best ball. The patriots have had an opposite season to last year, indeed to most of their years when they had playoffs success.<br/><br/>There are too many weak  links in this team right now. The injuries of course \u2013 they have had the highest number of injuries of any NFL team \u2013 but also certain structural issues like an offensive line that has never worked well this  season.  Can't have your quarterback always running for his life as soon as the ball is snapped. When the line is strong Brady still must get rid of the ball within three seconds. When the line is weak he can get sacked immediately, and often has this season. <br/><br/>Of Course I plan to root for them but my expectations are low and I know there will be no  love lost from Patriot detractors if they are \" one and done.\"", "createDate": "1452954426", "recommendations": 15, "updateDate": "1452954487", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 2073520, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/2073/520/cropped-2073520.jpg?0.18587254704312467", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17243450, "userLocation": "Florida", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17243108, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "John Ryan", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Hmm...when you sign murderers (Aaron Hernandez), video other teams practices, tamper with game balls and then destroy evidence (Tom Brady's cellphone) -- are you an NFL team or a crime syndicate?

The Pats' best hope of reaching the Super Bowl this year is if Pittsburgh could manage to beat Denver in the other Divisional Round game this weekend, but that seems unlikely, with both the Steelers' quarterback and their star wide receiver patched up and unlikely to last for the entire game, if they can even manage to start.  Were New England to eke out a win over Kansas City, itself a tough job, then probably it'd be on to Denver, where they seldom win.  And were they to reach the Super Bowl, they'd likely lose to a dominant, one-loss Carolina team.  The Patriots won their second championship, in 2003, over an earlier Panthers team, coached by John Fox, now the Denver Broncos' head coach - I'm sure the press will make something of this chance for Fox to redeem that earlier loss in next week's AFC Championship Game.  Worst of all would be for the Pats to meet the Seahawks in a Super Bowl rematch, only to lose.  New England has only a 50% record in the Super Bowl, although Belichik and Brady are 4-2.  Were they to lose their fifth such game, they'd have an overall losing record in nine Super Bowls.  So I'm resigned, one way or another, to 2016 not being their year, whether or not they beat the Chiefs today.", "createDate": "1452959511", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452981837", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 38969323, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17243108:17243959", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452981837", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Christine McMorrow", "commentID": 17243959, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17244178, "userLocation": "pembroke ma.", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17243108, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "biff murphy", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "now now christine lets keep up a positive attitude...go pats!", "createDate": "1452960591", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452981859", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74010180, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17243108:17244178", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452981859", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Christine McMorrow", "commentID": 17244178, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17243108", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452954487", "trusted": 1, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17243108, "replyCount": 3, "editorsSelection": false}
