Say something nice about Patriots once on a while!! \"Brady, as ever, might position the Patriots for glory. But he might need some assistance at the end.\"  Name a quarterback who does not! Besides, don't forget, it's Brady with his outsized role during the regular season and playoffs brought the team to Super Bowl in the first place. MVP award is not given to one flashy play. It is given to someone who has consistently played well all season long. And no one can deny that for the Patriots, it is usually Brady who does that.
