Buffalo held the ball for over 39 minutes, how was that Fitzpatrick's fault?<br/>In the first half Jet receivers had several dropped passes, killing at least two possessions.  Even Giselle Bundchen  knows the QB can't throw AND catch the ball.<br/>Today Fitz threw two TD passes with virtually no running game to balance the attack.  The last two interceptions were when the Jets were desperate and the Bills could attack the QB.  Give him a break.  Without Fitz, the Jets would have been a sub .500 team this year.", "createDate": "1451887011", "recommendations": 6, "updateDate": "1451920138", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 62348331, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17108887", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451920138", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17108887, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
