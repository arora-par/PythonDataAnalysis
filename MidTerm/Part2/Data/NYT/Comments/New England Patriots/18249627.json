The Yankees need to replace both if they are to launch another dynasty. If I were the owner, I would be looking at the Cardinal organization for a GM, and seeing if I could pry Mike Scioscia away from the Angels to manage, or bring back Donnie Baseball to manage. <br/><br/>I'm glad to see the Yankees adding more youth, but why not their own? And have they revamped their development program to teach a unified system of defense and hitting across all levels? Championships are developed, not bought, and for too long CASHman has resorted to the checkbook. We need new blood, and new ideas, coming from people who know baseball, not accounting and statistics.", "createDate": "1461025040", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1461023602", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 73348263, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18249627", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461027202", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18249627, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
