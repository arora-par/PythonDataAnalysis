Is it any wonder that so many prominent Republicans and businesses want nothing to do with this Trump-O-Rama?  Is it any wonder that they\u2019re afraid and ashamed of being associated with a candidate bellowing rape, murder, exclusion?  <br/><br/>But like it or not, that candidate is their candidate.  He is the public face now of a Party which for decades kept private their love affairs with Roy Cohn, Lee Atwater, and Karl Rove.  Indeed Roy Cohn was close friend and mentor to the young Trump during his most formative years, and indeed the apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.<br/><br/>So now there\u2019s no going back, no turning back or turning around.  The horse is out of the barn.  The bull is loose in the china shop.  Barnyard references come easily in regard to Mr. Trump. <br/><br/>You elected him.  You deserve him.  When your public humiliation in Cleveland comes to its end, just turn off the lights; your Party\u2019s over.", "createDate": "1468348327", "recommendations": 19, "updateDate": "1468348220", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 25295469, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "19122675", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1468351820", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 19122675, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
