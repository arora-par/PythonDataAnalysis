The letters I got were pretty awful -- sexist, violent, rude.  Some of them I still remember word for word.  I wrote back to every person and responded very nicely.  I asked them if they wanted to write an episode, and I said I would be really happy if they did and I would work with them.  <br/><br/>It was amazing how my putting a human face on the correspondence changed the tenor of it.  Many responded to me.  Some apologized.  All were sheepish.  I'm not sure what that means, but I ended up having good conversations with some of them.  All in all it was an interesting experience.  I doubt those guys sent emails like that to anyone again.
