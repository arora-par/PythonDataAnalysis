Take them from the fifty. If they go out of bounds untouched, or into the end zone, the receiving team gets a first and ten at the fifty. Make it more like a squib, in other words. (You could also do the same for a punt, if it goes out of bounds or into end zone, receiving team gets first fown at the line of scrimmage).<br/><br/>Re shootout. Have each team take turns with ball at the two yard line. They can score by a kick, for one point, or a run or throw, for two. Each team takes its turn till one team has a superior score. But each player can only score once. That is, only one kick fo the kicker, one run for the running back, one quarterback draw for the qb, etc. Instant excitement, and a lot of tactical decision making for the coach.", "createDate": "1455184573", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1455187761", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74368530, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17531896", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455187761", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17531896, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
