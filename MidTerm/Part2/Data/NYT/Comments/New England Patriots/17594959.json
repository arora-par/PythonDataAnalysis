Since Roger Goodell took responsibility of the NFL the NFL has more than double its revenue from $294M to $619M, social media following is larger than ever, new better sponsors and contracts, tapping into London, etc. If you bring in this much good anywhere else you get compensated for it. Also, the League does not pay him, the NFL owners do. What's the problem?<br/>Some people talk about inequality and corruption, but who is going to do what Goodell has done and stay happy with a 5 Million pay per year? It's just unrealistic. Some star players earned much more from their salary as well as sponsors and other earnings outside the sport. If you do not get paid as much is because you are not worth as much, because you do not bring enough money or following. This is a for-profit organization, the point here is to make money, and thanks to Goodell the NFL is making good money.
