Chashman was an intern who filled in where he could and earned his stripes in the organization by walking Watson out of the building on Mr. Watson's last day. What Cashman has done is a miracle of self-preservation. He took a great roster and rode it out, never replenishing it. Other teams like the Angels, Reds Sox, Dodgers and, of course, the Cardinals, have all drafted in the same area and had no trouble finding players. His player development record is abysmal. His ability to develop pitching is even worse than that. In fact, it could even be said that the Yankee organization ruins pitchers. Cashman's only championship came with a profligate spending spree that now has the club hamstrung. Mr. Watson was a very good player and a very good executive. He had too much class to act like an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect the bill (to quote a famous movie line). That role seems to suit Cashman just fine.", "createDate": "1460984689", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1461009269", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 4194197, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18242666", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461012869", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18242666, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
