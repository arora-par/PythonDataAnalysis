He's certainly the greatest team architect of the salary cap era.<br/><br/>He's also responsible for drafting, and building an offensive system around Brady. Who's to say he wouldn't have found an exceptional quarterback in Brady's absence? Or that Brady, in a different organization, would have been pedestrian? You can also argue that he wouldn't have been able to reach 5 consecutive AFC championships without players like Wilfork, Edelman, Revis, Welker, and Gronkowski.<br/><br/>Great coaches make great players and vice versa.", "createDate": "1453158382", "recommendations": 9, "updateDate": "1453161453", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 26699515, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17258908:17262487", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453161453", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Scott R", "commentID": 17262487, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17258908", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453127013", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17258908, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": false}
