Sports was the easy part. Academics were no cake walk... by the end of the school year, there had been just about 50% attrition, mainly due to academics. AND, once at USNA, all these athletes still have to perform academically and still have to graduate in four years with a minor in engineering, whatever their major. And for the vast majority of them, then have to serve five years as an officer in the Navy or Marine Corps. Hardly the boondoggle you suggest.", "createDate": "1481547383", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1481561217", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 78168958, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20776517", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481561217", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20776517, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
