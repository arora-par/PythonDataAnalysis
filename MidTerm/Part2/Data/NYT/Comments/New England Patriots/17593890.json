The NFL is comprised of white-male owners (97%) who are ultra-rich (100%). As of Oct, 2013, 72% of team upper management and executive positions are filled by white men. 70% of the players identify as 'a minority', 66% are African-American. To say the NFL is a 'rich white male' clique is an understatement.<br/><br/>The NFL tries to mask the dangers to their employees and goes to great lengths to hide those dangers. They pay lobbyists millions to avoid proper taxation classification, they hire politicians to work for them, they make a point of offering perks to politicians (think no further than Jones and Chris Christie), and they promote a college football 'feeder' program that takes advantage of college athletes who generate millions and millions for the schools they play for. <br/><br/>If we then consider how many stadiums are subsidized by the American tax-payer the NFL becomes not just a silly caricature but legalized corruption. SInce 1997 20 stadiums have received  over 4.7 billion in tax-payer municipal bonds as the Owners and Goodell milk us all the way to the bank.", "createDate": "1455673087", "recommendations": 20, "updateDate": "1455675943", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56610686, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/5661/0686/cropped-56610686.jpg?0.3164476181846112", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17594388, "userLocation": "Rausa", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17593890, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Sam", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "The NFL's revenues are passed through to the 32 teams, which pay income taxes.", "createDate": "1455678631", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1455689892", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 60837194, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17593890:17594388", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455689892", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "American Plutocracy", "commentID": 17594388, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17598077, "userLocation": "<br/>", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17593890, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Cheryl", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "The entire 501(c)  loophole should be eliminated, and much clearer standards set for qualifying as a non-profit , and only which provides a defined public good.
