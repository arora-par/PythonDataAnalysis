When you keep voting for the same type of pols owned by big money (i.e. Hillary Clinton and most of Congress), this is what you get. Ross Perot proved many Americans felt this way by getting 19 million votes in 1992 (and that was after he dropped out of the prez race and got back in). So, this anti--establishment feeling from many Americans is not knew. It is just economic conditions have worsened making people angrier and they are more of them then they were in 1992.

But that so-called political correctness includes racial and ethnic tolerance, along with an antipathy for authoritarian behavior. Trump's just made it ok for all those, both Repub- and Dem-leaning, to take off the mask and show their racist/authoritarian tendencies if they have them. This, and not Trump's political views, which except for immigration and the Muslim stuff, are actually relatively moderate, is the real reason people are flocking to him. The immigration and Muslim business is just racism in a different coat, called xenophobia.
