The Academies have a selectivity that rivals Harvard and Stanford. But their mission is very different, and that is reflected in their selection criteria. A nerdy high SAT student (and there are nerds at the Academies) probably doesn't translate into a lethal U.S. Marine. A smart disciplined middle linebacker has much more potential.<br/><br/>And Service Academy athletes take the same courses and trudge through the same tribulations as the other cadets and midshipmen. And in the end, they serve the country, often in the face of danger.<br/><br/>Finally, no, it wouldn't be the same if they were playing DIII versus DI. Williams College is a stellar academic institution, but playing Williams in football is not equivalent to playing Notre Dame. DI sports is tied to the imagine that the Academies need to maintain in order to attract the right pool of candidates.", "createDate": "1481481635", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1481490201", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 77882735, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20771715", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481490201", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20771715, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
