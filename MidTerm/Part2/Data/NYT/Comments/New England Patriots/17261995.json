It was a good call, very low risk, great chance to surprise a defense who were expecting Marshawn Lynch and probably would have stopped him the way they were set up. Russell Wilson made a decent pass, but just a phenomenal defensive from a guy who had no right to get to the ball won the game for the Bills. If you want an example about the Patriots for your article, think about the mentality of a defender in that position who knocks a receiver out of the way and makes a play.
