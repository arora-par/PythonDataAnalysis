They had no one to pass to except Beckham so the opposing defense could double Beckham and concentrate on the run without worrying about any other receivers getting open. In spite of that 5 games were in the win column until the final minute. There's nothing wrong with Coughlin that Cruz wouldn't have fixed. Blame Reese for not getting Coughlin a replacement for Cruz or a running back. And what about the injuries to the defense? It's not Coighlin who has to go...it's the administration that has to bring in healthy players.", "createDate": "1451820614", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1451843319", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 60785076, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17103032", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451843319", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17103032, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
