Good balance of both viewpoints and lack of bias, which is common in most publications about Poland nowadays (and not surprising, considering how polarizing the current government's actions are).<br/>Some food for thought too.. Perhaps it is just natural order? Perhaps it is what Poland really is and needs, as much as it pains us, Westerners and liberals? Perhaps it would actually feel and do better closer to Moscow than to Brussels?
