Benjamin Frankly said it well: \"Those willing to give up on freedom for a transient security, deserve neither\". A witch-hunt, the muzzling of the Press, and a closing of minds, is highly dangerous, and certainly anti-democratic. Poland seems to forget that the European Union was instrumental in their recovery from 'slavery' and humiliation, their suffering and sacrifices, now vindictive and isolationist and trying to shoot themselves in the foot with a radical right ideology, blind to the beauty of a shared future in real progress, beyond provincial ignorance.", "createDate": "1478114836", "recommendations": 18, "updateDate": "1478206376", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 47112177, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20340149", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1478209976", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20340149, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
