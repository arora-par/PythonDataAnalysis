Remove Edelman and this offensive attack begins to run on its rims.  Gronkowski's a mastodon, an easy target for even a high school QB; that said, Edelman's is always Brady's hard \"go to\" receiver when they MUST keep a drive alive.  On the defensive side, the Broncos should focus on LB Ninkovitch . . . and DE Jones.<br/>The Patriot's other soft spot is their offensive line. It's mediocre and can be broken down.<br/><br/>Short, less than a yard, 3rd down or goal line situation for NE ?<br/>Tom loves to take it over center, full arm extension.  A Bronco linebacker needs to time it up &amp; LT him . . .", "createDate": "1453130638", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1453131359", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 66948883, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17259510", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453131359", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17259510, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
