That means nothing. We all know that educated and experienced people make callous, self-centered decisions all the time.<br/><br/>People saying to give him a chance: His life was his chance. With that he chose to make inflammatory comments about all different groups of people. He has proven what he wants to do with his Harvard education, and that is to squander it making the world a more divisive place so his ego can survive.<br/><br/>I want to be pleasantly surprised at this cabinet. I hope this administrations ideas result in more jobs and better healthcare. But this is not looking good at all!", "createDate": "1479168834", "recommendations": 500, "updateDate": "1479174395", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 32782812, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/3278/2812/cropped-32782812.jpg", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20484893", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1479174394", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20484893, "replyCount": 6, "editorsSelection": true}
