There are some good teams out there, with talented and battle-proven qbs, wide receivers, offensive lines, pass rushers, safeties. And as we learned in the SB loss to the Giants, and the win over the SeaHawks, in a single game one or two key plays can result in a swing. The loss this year to Buffalo is hardly to be considered, since it was without not only Brady, but also the back-up quarterback who had been working (very well) as his replacement.  The loss this year to the Seahawks, though, shows how close some of these games can be, and week after week, throughout the league, a missed extra point or a dropped pass has made the difference between winning and losing.<br/><br/>So I'm waiting to see how the playoffs go, particularly since the Pats are now without Gronk, the one player on the Patriots which teams readily admit they can't match up against. The Pats will really need all their weapons in the playoffs this year.", "createDate": "1482692518", "recommendations": 5, "updateDate": "1482698607", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 65383389, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20907153", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1482698607", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20907153, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
