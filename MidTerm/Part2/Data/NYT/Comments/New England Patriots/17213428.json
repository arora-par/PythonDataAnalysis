Carolina made the schedule look easier by beating every team on the schedule. If you remove Caroli8na's games from their opponent records and do the same with Seattle there was only an 11 game gap out of the remaining 240 contests, 112-128 for Carolina 123-117 for Seattle. Not a huge gap in the quality of competition. AZ would be 119-121.<br/>And is it really \"uncharacteristic\" for Seattle to let teams win late in the game when they did so over a quarter of this season?", "createDate": "1452782274", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452792203", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74019196, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17213428:17220898", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452792203", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "br", "commentID": 17220898, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17225096, "userLocation": "Boston", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17213428, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "SMB", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "You misunderstand the relation of odds setting to actual predictive accuracy. A bet is a prediction. So yes, the odd-makers set initial odds and establish initial spreads as a best first prediction, to anticipate the expected flow of money. But the reason the odds and spread keep changing, dynamically, right up to the game, is that the national collective of bettors are a vast store of data about the teams' abilities and likelihoods of victory. Some good data, some bad, but ever expanding. As the numbers of bets increase day by day, their statistical power to predict increases. <br/><br/>The three factors you mention are already included in the bets, and across thousands and thousands of bettors. The fact that most spreads don't change dramatically simply reflects the odds-makers' skill (and routine access to more data and better software) than most of us. But nothing beats sample size.  it's the massive collective flow of money after the spread is established that drives things, not some cabal of stubborn non-believes in Vegas. I'd hold off on betting your farm, because a whole bunch of other people seem to believe otherwise, and they probably know as much or more about the data than you do...
