Designed, I guess, to give more common people a say in choosing a nominee it still attracts the more zealous members of either party (more left- or right-wing than the general populace) and candidates play the game of having to move to the center for the general election.  It costs the states a boat load of money, we're inundated for months on end about Iowa and New Hampshire and who ate a corn dog where - what a farce.<br/><br/>Frankly, I wish they'd just go back to the old convention model when it was a big push and shove of delegate voting to choose the nominee, no many how many ballots it took.  We certainly can't say that system produced anything worse in the past than the two appalling main contenders we have in 2016!", "createDate": "1468343633", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1468344721", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 42127981, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "19121574", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1468348321", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 19121574, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
