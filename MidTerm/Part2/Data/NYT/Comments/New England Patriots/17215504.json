It's difficult even to breathe and move. Nothing is a gimmie. The ball itself might have been a lumpy block of ice. <br/><br/>The better team won. If any team was \"lucky\" (and I hate assigning winning or losing to luck) it was Minnesota --playing in -6 degrees is what kept the game close. That was fortunate if not lucky. <br/><br/>Still, had the Seahawks lost I would never have complained. If the players didn't like it they could play better in the first half of the season so they don't have to play on the road in the playoffs. Minnesota earned the right to play at home --Seattle didn't. <br/><br/>Both teams earned what they got.
