If there were, we would be reading lots of quotes of hateful things he's said, and there don't seem to be any. Instead, the charge is that he uses the haters of the alt.right to attack the left. He seems quite happy to unleash the \"dogs of hell\" as long as they are going after the right targets.  That's ugly but it's not the same thing.
