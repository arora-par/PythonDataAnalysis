Not! He's just one guy who is part of an entire team that made New England look bad, on all fronts. While I'd likely choose Carolina too (as a team), why is it that older quarterbacks, and our elderly in general in this country, are written off so easily?<br/><br/>Instead of celebrating the experience and accomplishments of aging athletes, or our elderly population, people do smack-downs and troll them. The phrase, \"I've forgotten what you have yet to know\" comes to mind. Peyton clearly is the best game manager in the NFL - when the commentators putting him down can do better, please let us all know.", "createDate": "1453745822", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1453752855", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 62266564, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17333563", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453752855", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17333563, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
