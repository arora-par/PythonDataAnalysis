You do realize that they can commit a penalty with little consequence - what's the worst that is going to happen? Move the ball a few inches? There have been situations of blatant holding which the refs have missed - the defense will rush the passer making him throw fast and if the receiver doesn't react quickly or the defense jumps it(see Seattle Vs NE Jan 2015), you lose those points. The NE CB jumped the route because he had little to lose, most expected Seattle to score any way, but that was for the Super Bowl - imagine the defense taking a risk over one or two points - of course, every defense will jump the pass or commit a penalty", "createDate": "1453254029", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453254563", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 45176228, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17270652:17274276", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453254563", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "John", "commentID": 17274276, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17270652", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453233262", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17270652, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": false}
