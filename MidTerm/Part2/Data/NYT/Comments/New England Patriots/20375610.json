Instead, let me just give one number which everybody can verify - 2.5 million people emigrated from Poland after joining European Union a decade or so ago. To keep this number in perspective and to keep right proportion it is the same as if over 30 millions of young Americans would leave the country looking for jobs.<br/>Now, a minute of reflection should be enough to realize what a devastating effect it has on communities, on families, on economic life, tax collection, education, future of the country, etc. .<br/>This whole talk of \"economic miracle\" in Poland reflects growing margins for banks rather than reality of life for average citizens.<br/>With this in mind, isn't it natural that society tires to defend itself ?<br/>Or, it is what the author of the article calls turn to \"nationalism\"?<br/>Politics is not about profits it is about people.", "createDate": "1478450034", "recommendations": 6, "updateDate": "1478471651", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 77484109, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20375610", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1478471651", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20375610, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
