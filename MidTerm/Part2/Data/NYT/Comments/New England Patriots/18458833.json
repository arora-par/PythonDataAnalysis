The replay, the constant bantering between the announcers, the commercials that interfere with the game, and the fact that I'd rather be outside than listening to the nonsense mean that I don't have to listen.  I watch the birds, read books, swim, bike, cook, or do something for myself.  Replays slow the game down, destroy continuity, and don't the fans any favors either.  All the statistics that are broadcast are meaningless too.  This is for tennis, not the NFL but from what I've seen and read, it applies there too.  In fact it applies to life.  We are constantly being second guessed on what we do.  Never do we hear from our friends, our families, or anyone, that we did the best we could with the information we had.  It's as if we were supposed to know how things would turn out in advance.  <br/><br/>Life, like sports, has to be lived forward while looking back. But what needs to be taken into account is that we don't always have the knowledge or view another person has.  Perhaps we need to learn to make the calls on what we see, not the replay.  It's called dealing with it unless it's such a serious infraction that revisiting it will right a wrong.  Now, I think I'll go read my book.", "createDate": "1462665208", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1462661650", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 12443097, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 18464241, "userLocation": "Norwich, VT", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 18458833, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Gene Nattie", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "I agree wholeheartedly with Hen3ry.

They compare ballplayers' single season and career stats without mentioning that the seasons are longer.
