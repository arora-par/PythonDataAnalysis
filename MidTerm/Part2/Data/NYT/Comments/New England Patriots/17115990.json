I was 16 years old in 1964 when I went to the first football game played at Shea with the new Jets (former Titans). I saw Joe Namath live a few times. And before I was in the service in 1969, I saw the Jets win the Super Bowl. I've now seen stadiums go up, and stadiums come down. I've seen teams go up, and then down.
