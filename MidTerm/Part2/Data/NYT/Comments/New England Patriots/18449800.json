In this case, with very little extra time, you get a clear indication of whether a ball is in or out.<br/><br/>The only thing they have yet to do is add this technology to clay court tennis, because of the tradition of chair umpires using ball marks in the clay to identify the result. I think they should add it to clay court tennis, at least as a back-up to verify the umpire's reading of the clay in really close calls.<br/><br/>Perhaps, sophisticated real-time computer analysis of play on a basketball court, or even on a football or baseball field could be used to speed up the results of replays there, also?  I realize this is a much more complex task for a computer, and would probably cost many times what it costs to do in tennis, even if it were technically possible.", "createDate": "1462576412", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1462673794", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 15918791, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 18464580, "userLocation": "Hamilton, Ontario", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 18449800, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Stan", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "The tennis review is \"inarguable\" because the players accept the futility of arguing it.  Most viewers believe it is a replay of the shot, but in reality it is a computer simulation of the  trajectory of the ball, based on measurements of its remotely measured location at various times during its trajectory.  It is surely quite accurate, but also surely not as accurate as claimed, or to the precision that is used in making judgements in the game.  The idea that this simulation might be truer to the real trajectory of the ball than the actual physical trace the ball makes in soft clay is absurd.  Weather forecasting has become quite accurate, but if the computers predict sun and it rains, it's not the clouds who have made the error.", "createDate": "1462718265", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1462741246", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 15170127, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "18449800:18464580", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462744846", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Daniel Rose", "commentID": 18464580, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 18466697, "userLocation": "San Francisco", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 18449800, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Chris Kox", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "You can't possibly be a Mass native with this digital vision of sport.
