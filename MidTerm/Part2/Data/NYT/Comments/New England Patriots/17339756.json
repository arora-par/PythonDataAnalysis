From that vantage point, I appreciated very differently a game, or presumably a different game itself, that others apparently watched or reviewed. Taking absolutely nothing from an impressive Denver team, I did not see a superlative defensive showing from as much as I saw Brady making his worst judgments of the season. I did see a New England defense, that for whatever reason had not received nearly the same or even similar attention as their offense, keeping their offense in the game. I also saw Belichick, possibly out of some peculiar hubris or arrogance, denying the obvious and attempting a ridiculous fourth down conversion in lieu of an almost sure field goal with over five minutes left. This game was still so much up for grabs given a porous Patriots' offensive line and its associated woes that giving much more than passing credit to the Broncos seems impossible. The score reflected an utter coaching meltdown- never mind a missed extra point.
