For the same reason Joe Torre had to go before him. What did Torre go 8 years without a championship, with the highest payroll, and best team. He didn't win with the dodgers either. Girard has now entered his 7'th season since he won a championship. Time to go. Fire his butt too. What are we going to let him manage ten more years without a championship here in new york. George steinbrenner would be so dissapointed in son hal. Hal is a useless joke. Son hank should be in charge. Son hank would win championships. Take heed put hal, and cashman, and Girard in a uhaul truck one way to Tampa where they belong in the minors. Put hank in the big Apple where he belongs. And hire loud piniella, don baylor, city gaston, or buck showalter. We would win a championship very soon. Also hire Dan duquette as general manager. Keep arod, and bat him second. No more excuses. George must be turning over in his grave. Shame on all of you clowns. Put hank in charge with duquette. We deserve better.", "createDate": "1460960408", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1461002684", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 75011131, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 18247912, "userLocation": "Lexington, KY", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 18240475, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Centrist", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Pure nonsense.", "createDate": "1461010258", "recommendations": 8, "updateDate": "1461009345", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 2271826, "picURL": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "18240475:18247912", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461012945", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Future general manager", "commentID": 18247912, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "18240475", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461006284", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18240475, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": false}
