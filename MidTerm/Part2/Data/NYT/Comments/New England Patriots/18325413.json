It's not about whether anything wrong was actually done, merely whether or not Goodell can suspend players based on little evidence. If they had any, we'd have seen the results of their random PSI testing from this year for comparison.<br/><br/>But hey, four opponents of the Patriots just issued a collective sigh of relief. If you can't beat em, make something up and hope the League is looking for a win after bungling two domestic violence suspensions. Not so catchy, but it fits.", "createDate": "1461604245", "recommendations": 137, "updateDate": "1461602288", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56181442, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18325413", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461605888", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18325413, "replyCount": 7, "editorsSelection": true}
