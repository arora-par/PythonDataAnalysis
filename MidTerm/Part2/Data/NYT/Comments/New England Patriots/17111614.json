I was beginning to feel that funny feeling that other long suffering Jets fans can only appreciate. That feeling that something is just a little off in this orderly world. The Jets were winning. Playing smart. Luck was actually leaning towards green. That maybe this is the year. This one is different. And then, as per usual.........wait for it......wait for it............THUNK!<br/>And that, my friends, is the other shoe.<br/>IMHO, the Jets are only capable of two types of seasons. The first type is last season, playing miserably all year, no hope, a laughingstock. At least during those seasons I get to spend Sundays with my kids. And then there is 2015-16. These type of seasons, the Jets tease you with just enough talent and lucky breaks to hook you to your television until the end. And then after investing your limited and precious weekend time, hope and emotion, they dump you like yesterdays trash.<br/>Jets fans are proud of their futility. Now I feel whole again.
