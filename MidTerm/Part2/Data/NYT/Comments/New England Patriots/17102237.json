However, for me, he pulled off a hidden miracle.  If every game the Giants played ended at 58 minutes, Big Blue's record would be 11 wins, 3 defeats and one tie.  And this for a team that had no running game, no defense, a decimated offensive line and innumerable injuries.  However, between the draft, free agency and the salary cap money the Giants have along with the return of Victor Cruz, Jon Beason and other starters, the Giants can field a team with a decent defense and a potent offense led by Eli Manning that can better this years high ranking offense.  In short, I hope Mr. Tisch and Mr. Mara come to the conclusion I have come to which is as long as Eli, the on-field leader is the Giant's Quarterback, Coach Coughlin should remain the coach.  It isn't often you have a Hall of Fame coach whose statistics can match every other coach except one, the coach he has beaten in the Super Bowl.", "createDate": "1451796622", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1451841721", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 32083467, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17102237", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451841721", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17102237, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
