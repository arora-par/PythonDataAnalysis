I completely misjudged the Super Bowl this year; I think that is part of what makes football so fascinating. But for the noncatch two plays before defensive touchdown, what would the game have been like? The twists of so many plays: drops, slips, blown calls. It still could have gone either way.<br/>Your reforms are all good. Football in its current manifestation is ridiculously unsafe (at any level). As a physician, I think the medical profession should refuse to approve children who have yet to go through puberty to play tackle football. That would stop it quicker than legislation, and open leagues up to even more intense litigation. The NFL cynically supports youth football because it may get more players in the pipeline and it lets all the psycho male coaches have an outlet for their pathology on these children (much of what is called coaching is tantamount to child abuse). To those who say there is not enough evidence youth football causes CTE, I say, there is not enough evidence it doesn't, so it shouldn't be played until that is the case.", "createDate": "1455151005", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1455151028", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 61250025, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17529090", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455151028", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17529090, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
