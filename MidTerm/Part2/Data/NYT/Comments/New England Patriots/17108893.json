Although, Suh weighs 307 pounds! The ugliness of his vocal threats and behaviors against quarterbacks are ignored by the zebras, team owners and coaches plus Commissioner Goodell who is always claiming integrity is his concern. Desperation is the catalyst which  justifies Suh\u2019s  exorbitant salary. The owners and coaches want Suh to destroy their competition and change the dynamics of having the best teams compete for the Superbowl. NFL players like Suh, who get paid big bucks to harm the opposition stretch the credibility of any shred of integrity within the NFL hierarchy. The league\u2019s administration is overdue for a reorganization:  unjustified poor officiating, purposeful harm to competing team players that is ignored and which which begs the question of gross negligence by Goodell.", "createDate": "1451887202", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1451921450", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 71299340, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17108893", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451921450", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17108893, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
