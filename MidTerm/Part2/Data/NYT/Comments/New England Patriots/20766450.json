Schools, UNC. for example, admitting athletes who read at the 3rd grade level. Perhaps it is time for colleges to admit that athletes cannot really do a real academic load. It is time to shed the pretense-and for universities to come clean-either have an admission standard-or develop one for athletes who may not qualify. And if that is the case-how do they get a college education. In the case of UNC-as published reports tend to show-having tailor-made course for them-which is a disgusting revelation.<br/>The whole US University program with athletes leaves a bad taste with regard to what a degree means to a college athlete. Some are real students-but how to quantify a degree to an athlete who did not take the major core courses? American universities must come to grips with this problem-there is no way a full-time athlete at a major university in American can carry a real-full time load of academics. To offer to cheapen the athlete's load is to cheapen all degrees offered by that university to all students. And that is the real problem.
