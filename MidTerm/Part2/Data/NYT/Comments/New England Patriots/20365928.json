Just look at France, the Calais situation went from bad to worse, the makeshift camps in Calais are just now mostly closed but that did not solve the problem whatsoever;  the migrants are now camping in the streets in ordinary people's neighborhoods in Paris, disrupting their lives.  Either the migrants should be put up in genuine housing until their claims are processed or else repatriated (mandatory) to their home countries pronto, if their claims are rejected.  But the Current French government is evidently powerless / impotent, and law &amp; order is not enforced and control is not applied.  Poles do not want such a migrant crisis let alone Islamic terror to inflict their country.  In the end, L&amp;J may have better policies for ordinary citizens than the current left leaning western governments have.
