They only played 4 playoff teams (Texans, Packers, Seahawks, and Washington), and the wins against the Texans and Seahawks came at a point when those teams were struggling and didn't look like potential playoff teams.  That isn't to say that Carolina is necessarily weaker than its 15-1 record suggests, but they are relatively untested and so their real strength is uncertain.  In recent years teams which start off the season strong often fade, as injuries take hold or as other teams surge late in the season.  Of course this is why we actually watch the games and not just the stats!", "createDate": "1452792486", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452795410", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 15170127, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17226971, "userLocation": "USA", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17223926, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "William Johnson", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Carolina is 3-0 against playoff teams this year.
