When asked questions about Chandler, he declines to answer and wonders if there are any football-related questions. <br/><br/>When asked about how he plans to use Chandler in the game, Belichick says maybe he should \"Xerox you a copy of the game plan, and you can send it over to Kansas City.\" Perhaps Belichick can offer up a list of pre-approved questions for the media to ask. <br/><br/>It's not just the media; he seems to barely tolerate his coaching peers in pre- and post-game moments. Personally, I'm long since tired of his pompous, superior disdain toward others. Within the game or outside of it, he's a sterling example of how not to behave.", "createDate": "1452962305", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452981881", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 63513294, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17244489", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452981881", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17244489, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
