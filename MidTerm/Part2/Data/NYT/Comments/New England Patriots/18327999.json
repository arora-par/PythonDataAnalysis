It proved he COULD be innocent. But science wasn't involved in Pats' trainers texting about deflating the footballs.  In a court of law, that would be called cold, hard evidence. Nor was science involved in Brady destroying his cellphone. In a court of law, that would be called obstruction of justice. And his testimony? It wasn't even in open court, so how does anyone know whether he was truthful or not. All of the documented evidence speaks against him. His actions speak against him. And action is louder than words, in my book.", "createDate": "1461617826", "recommendations": 44, "updateDate": "1461614754", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 52533045, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18327727:18327999", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461618354", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Snow in July", "commentID": 18327999, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": true}
