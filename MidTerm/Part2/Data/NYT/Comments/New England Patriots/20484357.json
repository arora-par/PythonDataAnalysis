Are we only concerned about appearances or what? Mr. Bannon's influence and seal are all over Trump himself --even before Trump hired him. That he has an official position in the cabinet or not is irrelevant. Mr. Trump exposes Bannon's views often, sometimes daily. Why are people surprised? Let him have his appointment --may the limelight force a reckoning, or not-- but America voted for Mr. Trump and his views and the awfulness of a Trump Presidency should be displayed and not hidden --may his cabinet be what he campaigned for!", "createDate": "1479165844", "recommendations": 429, "updateDate": "1479168376", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 63549582, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20484357", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1479168376", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20484357, "replyCount": 15, "editorsSelection": true}
