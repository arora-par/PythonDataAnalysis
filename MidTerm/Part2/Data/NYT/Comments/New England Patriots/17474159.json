I think he is a more worthy entrant than several of the \"contributors\" in the HOF. But, for some reason, there is a lot ill will toward him. Maybe Eddie just won too many games. Better to be a nice guy like Jim Finks who never won a league championship and is in the Hall.<br/>Getting into the HOF is always a highly subjective assessment carried out by highly opinionated sportswriters whose strengths do not include reason and impartiality. The result has been that nearly every Steeler from the 70's who was even above average is in the HOF, while Kenny Stabler, a player good enough to beat those guys, had to die without induction.
