They bring in players, and by great coaching, make them great players.  The coaches teach, they motivate, and they bring out the best in players.  <br/><br/>Consistently having competent/capable players is not an accident - it's great coaching in all elements (selecting players, teaching players, motivating players, and great on-field strategy and tactics), and not just by Belichick.  He brings in coaches and they either learn how to be great coaches, or they're gone.  <br/><br/>But, when the assistants go to other teams, they don't have the overall approach - elements/aspects of management/coaching they experience under Belichick they don't recognize as important and then don't duplicate, but then they don't duplicate the results.  <br/><br/>Belichick.  Reporters should ask him how he does it.  He'll tell you - he loves to talk to reporters.  (That last bit was sarcasm).
