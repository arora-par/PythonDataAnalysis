But that confidence sure did wane when Comey did the unthinkable and meddled with the election in an overt and shameful fashion.<br/><br/>What worries me most is the DAMAGE that Donald J. Trump has done to this country.  It wasn't \"waking up\" the racist and isolationist flag wavers, but emboldening them to feel they have a LEGITIMATE CAUSE to push.  When Trump loses, he will fan the flames and stoke it with the fuel of hatred, distrust, and viciousness.  These people who support him are troubled... and they need help to change their ways, not encouragement to deepen their angst.", "createDate": "1478647760", "recommendations": 9, "updateDate": "1478648576", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 43061552, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4306/1552/cropped-43061552.jpg?0.05739315785467625", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20401562", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1478648576", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20401562, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
