As a lifelong all Cleveland sports fan, I can still remember exactly where I was during the 1997 WS Game 7, and everything else in between. My dad had season tickets to the Browns from 1977-1995, and I remember many cold Sundays in Municipal, screaming as loud as I could. It's great to see an article from the daughter's perspective, and I'm glad that Ms. Hoppert can share a Cleveland championship with her dad as I did with mine last week. Thank you so much for writing this piece.
