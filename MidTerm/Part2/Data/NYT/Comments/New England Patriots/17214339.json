However, that only happened once during their last seven games. Recall that they were 2-4, then 5-5, and finished 10-6. Growth during the second half of the season is always the determining factor in predicting a playoff team's promise and potential for a run at the big game. The problem of finishing a game, as much as it might be so, seems resolved for Seattle, lucky missed field goal or not. What was evident about the Panthers, however, in the December game against the Giants, was that they did not finish well. Carolina has coasted to victories too often. They do not play well from behind. This season, Carolina had four 4th quarter comebacks (against Seattle when they were fishtailing, Colts without Luck, the Saints - nothing more need be said, and the aforementioned Giants). During the second half of the season, Seattle, at times, still took a quarter or two to get in the grove of the game, but once the 2nd half starts (Pete Carroll - whether in Seattle and at USC - is among the best coaches at adjusting at half), the 'Hawks are formidable foes. Regardless of the score at the mid-point, the game will be resolved in the 4th, and it will be close. And be assured, Beast or no Beast, if the opportunity emerges to punch it over the line, Seattle will.

Definitely impressive. Newton and Olsen were on fire.<br/>It will take everything the Seahawks can muster to beat an excellent Panthers team. Fortune favors the Seahawks this time around with LB Bobby Wagner, DT Jordan Hill, and CB Jeremy Lane back in action. The drama of SS Kam Chancellors hold out is far behind them now, and Russell Wilson and his receiving core, in particular Doug Baldwin are have been playing lights out, subtracting last week in the deep freeze, though obviously, the wizardry still popped at the critical points.<br/>The Panthers are rested, confident, talented, and hungry.<br/>It will be very difficult to beat them. I sure hope the Seahawks do!<br/>It could end up being a nail biter, and very entertaining.
