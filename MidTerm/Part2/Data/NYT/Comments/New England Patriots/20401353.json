Are we as good as Hillary says? No is the answer for both questions. Probably somewhere in the middle which is where we will probably be four years from now. Trump pictures a journey back to how things use to be. He rose on the ideal time to be a non politician. Once elected, if he is, he can never claim that title again. Once in, you are in. No matter who wins tonight, half the Country will be upset in the morning. When all the dust is settled, Blue and Red states need to be forgotten. Hopefully back to the United States.
