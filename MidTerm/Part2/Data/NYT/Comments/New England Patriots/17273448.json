I do not admire Herm Edwards, but his famous rant was technically correct: you play to win the game! Is it easier to cover two yards or win a coin toss and cover 80 or score after stopping the other team? Why, as an owner, would you fire a guy for trying to win the game?<br/><br/>I have not watched the video, but did Marshawn Lynch run the correct pattern?<br/>Wilson thought he would be going the other way.<br/><br/>Keep beating the drum against youth football. It saddens me every time I do physicals to allow children to play full pads football. It shouldn't be an option, and I wish there was a way I could no and not get in trouble.", "createDate": "1453249739", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1453254292", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 61250025, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17273448", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453254292", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17273448, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
