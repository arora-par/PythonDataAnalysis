Ironically, when the smoke and mirrors failed in crunch time--as they had to--it was Coughlin who looked bad. And that was part of the magic, too: keep the team from losing confidence. Remove Coughlin, and you'll see what a mice-and-pumpkin team the Giants really are. I'd suggest, Coughlin earned a raise and some good players. Folks who think another coach could have done better are delusional.", "createDate": "1451830945", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1451843581", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 59849237, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/5984/9237/cropped-59849237.jpg", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17103799", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451843581", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17103799, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
