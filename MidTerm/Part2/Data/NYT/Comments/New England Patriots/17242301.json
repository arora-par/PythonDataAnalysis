It's the highlight of many a day.<br/><br/>Almost all of the NFL's rule changes have made the game better and/or safer. There is one exception. A total revolution in what is deemed a catch needs to be made.<br/><br/>First, a catch in the end zone should be made consistent with the the rule for a runner breaking the plane of the end zone. A receiver in the end zone has already broken the plane, so if he has possession for any period of time, even in the air, it should be a TD, even if he drops the ball when he goes to ground. Next, the go to ground rule outside of the end zone needs to be changed to be consistent too. If he secures the ball in the air it is a catch even going to ground and dropping the ball on contact. The one exception should be if the ball is secured in the air by being pinned against a body part other than cradled in the hands or arms when caught in the air, he needs to have possession for at least a heartbeat after he hits the ground. From listening to discussions about the rules by professional commentators, former players and fans, I think these suggestions are more what people want. Obviously, it's opinion.", "createDate": "1452948927", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452948968", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 51185127, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/5118/5127/cropped-51185127.jpg?0.06334015138636656", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17242301", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452948968", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17242301, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
