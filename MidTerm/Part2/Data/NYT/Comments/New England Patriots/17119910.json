That would give the ownership another year to evaluate if McAdoo is ready to take over. The reason is Eli, at 35 you don't want to change his offense with another coordinator. A new coach would have the right to change the staff and Eli has made it clear that's not something he wants. Its also not clear who's the best available coach? Tom C. in this situation probably makes the most sense.
