Players have long resented their salaries being \"capped,\" whereas the Commissioner and owners have no cap. Another source close to the Commissioner reported that Goodell and 12 of the League's 32 owners proposed privately that the NFL eliminate the Pro Bowl in its current format and replace it with Madden Football.  If that proves successful, the League will expand the season to 18 games with each team having two Madden contests. There were disagreements about whether to use X Box, or Play Station with the Commissioner suggested that the home team choose the format. Players used by the Madden sikulation would receive minimal compensation based upon their fantasy football points.", "createDate": "1455716154", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1455725647", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 74082668, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17596937", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455725647", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17596937, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
