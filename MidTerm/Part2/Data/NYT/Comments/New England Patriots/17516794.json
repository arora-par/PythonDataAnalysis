Memorizing the plays required a huge amount of effort and the better we executed the better we did.  But you had to improvise.  And you really had to study the video.  You could predict a lot. This super bowl was a textbook game ......our coaches always preach defense and we kids never really really believe it.  Your recommendations are really good....padding changes and helmet changes such as no helmet or minimal helmets might make players think twice.  Overally you have done a  great job on this and I hope the powers that be read your post carefully.  The game is too much fun to give up.......let us make it better.", "createDate": "1455076468", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1455077272", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 30913699, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17516794", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455077272", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17516794, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
