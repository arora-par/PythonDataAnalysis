Go into the ordinary workplace and you go beyond talk to consequences for working women in terms of opportunity and pay that are based on unspoken prejudice.<br/><br/>Twitter could stop this in a heartbeat.  Yahoo could stop this.  The businesses employing these women could find ways to support these women and stop this as well - but they are forcing these women to confront these messages on a 7x24x356 basis.
