I don't care about any NFL team, but I like science and sports stories.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Nocera's premise is just as suspect as the other side. His analysis is essentially that the NFL had no solid evidence against the Patriots, and paid for a manufactured report on the situation. To my ears, that fails to consider several questions of fact, as well as some admittedly vague questions of character:<br/><br/>Why did the Patriots footballs deflate, while Indianapolis' footballs did not (Nocera's article mentions this, but leaves it unanswered)?<br/><br/>How do you account for the Patriots locker-room attendant known as \"The Deflater,\" who took the suspect footballs into the bathroom for 90 seconds right when the deflation would have occurred?<br/><br/>Why did Brady destroy his cell phone when it was requested as evidence in this case?<br/><br/>This article cites one scientist who argues against intentional deflation. That's fine. But that's not a scientific consensus. What about all the other scientific analyses that support intentional deflation?<br/><br/>Perhaps too circumstantial, but intentional deflation does fit Belichick's rather checkered history. It's doubtful his entire reputation is due to envy.<br/><br/>I'm betting that something dishonest was occurring in the Patriots' locker room, but probably not quite what some assume.<br/><br/>Both sides in situations like this can become entrenched in their own perspective, then reject any analysis that contradicts that perspective.", "createDate": "1453584320", "recommendations": 18, "updateDate": "1453584661", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 15158690, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17316885, "userLocation": "Boston, MA", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17316408, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Sunil Kamath", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Take the time to view the Youtube video- all your questions about deflation will be answered.

If you read ANYTHING on this subject you would know that the Colts balls did deflate.  Yes, they had higher PSI levels than the Pats balls, but that is explained by TWO THINGS: 1) The Colts balls started 1 PSI higher (Luck prefers them this way).  2) The Colts balls were measured at the END of halftime allowing them to WARM UP more than the PATS' balls and GAIN PSI... In fact, only FOUR COLTS' balls were measured because of this.<br/><br/>Can people really be this unintelligent??
