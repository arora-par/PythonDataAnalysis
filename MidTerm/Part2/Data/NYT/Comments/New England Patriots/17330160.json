(You're not going to get very far when you have to sign a running back out of retirement at the end of the season!)<br/><br/>As good as Denver's defense played - and they definitely brought their \"A\" game yesterday - it was still a nail-biter, and the Pats could have forced overtime or even won the game. There are plenty of Pats \"haters\" out there, but tell me all of you don't envy their ability to get back to the playoffs every year and even contend for the conference championship despite the turnover on their roster. (And spare me the \"cheater\" chatter: \"Deflategate\" has been largely debunked; see the article about it elsewhere in the Times sports section.)<br/><br/>Now, Denver may have won itself a booby prize. What Carolina did to Arizona last night - one of the league's best defensive teams - is downright scary. They just ran, passed, and scored at will, and forced 7 turnovers to score 49 points. Is the Denver offense good enough to overcome this runaway train?  Peyton will see intense pressure and strong pass coverage in two weeks.
