No matter who he puts out on the field, they win. As longs as Brady is at the helm. As a Jets fan appreciating him is not easy, but at least we've given them some of their toughest victories, thrown in with a few losses.<br/>What I love about Bellichek besides his coaching, is his refusal to pander to the league politics. In the interview room, he's testy, and tightlipped. No sweet PR coming from his mouth, no tolerating media fools. I have to think that attitude is also present in meetings and the game day locker room. <br/><br/>You don't perform, you don't play much. Parcells had that same mentality. Unlike a Rex Ryan who tolerated incompetency for years, with stiffs like Sanchez and then Gino Smith. Neither of them would have lasted long with Big Bill, where mental mistakes are sins.<br/>From this point of view, I'm enjoying our new coach Todd Bowles. Gino Smith never saw the field once Fitzgerald played. The mistakes he made were always physical, not mental, and those happen in the NFL.<br/>Let's hope Bowles can find a way to one day beat the dreaded demon genius of New England.
