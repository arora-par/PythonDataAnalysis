I know that he had the respect of his teammates and in the parlance of sports \"left it all on the field\".  I also think that he is a very smart individual (undergraduate at Cal Berkley).  All that being said, I wouldn't rule out Marshawn just deciding to now just go live a normal life away from the NFL.  He is I'm sure financially secure.  And again with his smarts he probably has decided, with all the revelations about CTE and just having endured an injury riddled season, that it's time to go. So, Marshawn, I thank you for all your efforts exerted on behalf of the Seahawks and wish you a long and happy life.
