I think, too, even those of us in the Navy who didn't attend the Academy have a special place in our hearts for that institution, more so than the other services have for their schools.  Other, more negative, comments aside -- many with which I agree -- I think Mr Nocera provided an interesting insight to this particular slice of college athletics.  Mr Peter Banos' experience notwithstanding, I have spoken with some NAPS students, in the past, and they all had expressed very positive experiences of the institution.  From experience, I can say that USNA graduates are some of the finest individuals with whom I've worked in either the public or private sectors.", "createDate": "1481419544", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1481426798", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 42375269, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20766316", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481426798", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20766316, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
