Trump is merely the first wave of a Tsunami put into motion almost fifty years ago by Nixon's Southern Strategy. That fragile and unholy alliance of Dixiecrats and bankers glued together with poor and middle class whites has now come undone. Democrats should note that this seismic fracture, set into motion by stagnant living standards and smoldering frustration, was aided and abetted by the Carters, the Clintons, and the Obamas. As Mr Bruni observes, the Trump wave is sweeping away the Republican Party. People like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are scattering like sand crabs. What will go when the second wave hits? The Bernie Sanders phenom was merely an advance signal of the social energy gathering. A few more Dutch boys won't save this tattered dike. We are looking at a political Katrina. Anyone tempted to gloat should be heading for high ground.", "createDate": "1466336941", "recommendations": 144, "updateDate": "1466339863", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74076285, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18888445", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466343463", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18888445, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": true}
