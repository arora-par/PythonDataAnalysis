His answer was measured and full of wisdom.  He said his former coach and friend, Tony Dungy, called him and told him that whatever decision he makes, if he makes it as a snap judgement, at the moment, he WILL regret it.  Therefore Manning will take time with his family to vacation for a couple of weeks--I'm sure they'll hit a beach somewhere as the kids aren't school age yet, he'll talk to his wife, his brothers, and, of course, his mom and dad, the former Pro-Bowler, Archie Manning.  Then I expect he'll announce his retirement.<br/><br/>I'm not actually a fan of Peyton Manning's, and, being a Progressive, it's hard to forget and forgive his endorsements for reactionary Papa John's Pizza, where I refuse to eat.  But as a football player, Manning has always been a class act, a GREAT player and I have to respect that.   I hope, in retirement, he can address all the lifetime pain and injuries players accrue.  Most of the 49 MVPs yesterday, especially the older ones, were walking with difficulty.<br/>Except Jerry Rice who STILL looks like he could out-cut a cornerback and run for the end-zone!", "createDate": "1454964067", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1454966555", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 21069407, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17499538", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454966555", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17499538, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
