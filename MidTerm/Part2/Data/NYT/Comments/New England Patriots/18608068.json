The man himself really doesn't deserve much more explaining. He has said very little that is real news in month, yet the American news sources can't seem to stop themselves from making news for him. No one in recent memory, including the Kardashians, has gotten more free publicity by simply saying the same inane things over and over again. I don't believe that publishers, writers and pundits are really doing their readers a service by chasing their byline and being played by the Trump candidacy.
