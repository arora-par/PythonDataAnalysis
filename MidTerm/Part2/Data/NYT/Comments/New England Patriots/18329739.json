When Deflategate was current news, I would have easily refuted every reason given for believing Tom Brady deserving of a 4 game suspension.  But at this point, like most Patriot fans, I have learned that bias rules when it comes to the Patriots and regardless of the facts, which most fans who do not live in New England gleefully ignore, you are wasting your breath arguing.<br/><br/>Tom Brady has become my favorite player because of the way he conducted himself through the Deflategate mess and I am behind him 100%.  The NFL and the other 31 team owners though, have lost my respect.   However this comes out, I feel fortunate to have watched Tom Brady play football for the past 15 years and look forward to every game he plays from now until the day he retires.
