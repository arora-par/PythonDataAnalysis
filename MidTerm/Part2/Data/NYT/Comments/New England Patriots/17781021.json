As this article states, the league already had all the messages that were on that phone and if there was any \"smoking gun\" in those messages, the NFL would have been shouting it from the roof tops. The validity of the Wells report has been destroyed in several reviews as fundamentally flawed from a scientific perspective. PV still equals nRT, even in the NFL.<br/><br/>This whole sorry episode is not about deflated footballs, it is about Goodell throwing his weight around after stupid decisions on his part on other suspensions and trying to knock down one of the most successful franchises in the modern NFL era, who are successful despite the salary caps. When you come down to it, the Patriots success stems from good management, competent coaching and exceptional professionalism of players like Brady.
