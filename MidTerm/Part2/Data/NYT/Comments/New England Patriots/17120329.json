He has been remarkable for his failure in almost every aspect of his job, yet he remains.<br/><br/>The Giants are a talent poor team with a high payroll. Reese has selected numerous players who have been incompetent, both draft choices and free agents. He doesn't recognize talent. <br/><br/>In addition Reese has failed to lead the organization strategically. He allowed his head coach to pad his win record in meaningless games thereby squandering the opportunity to give inexperienced players the reps that would make them more capable. He allowed his head coach to win games where losses would have improved draft position and the teams future. Other teams took advantage of that situation. Other teams improved.<br/><br/>Reese is home grown. He is emblematic of the Giants. He, and the Mara family, stand for defeat. They make money. They don't win. <br/><br/>Who would want to join this failed organization? What coach would hang his future on Reese and his management team? The Giants aren't in the drivers seat. All they have going for them is the big city. With Reese still in place, that won't ever be enough.", "createDate": "1451996746", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1452009666", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 40982148, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17120329", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452009666", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17120329, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
