I married and moved to France, and through it all I have always been and always will be a Cavs fan. I was overjoyed when Lebron James choose to play in Cleveland (he was at home) I felt betrayed and cried when he left. I was at home visiting family when he came home and celebrated with my city. Even though I had to get up early to go to work (because of the time difference) I stayed up to watch game seven. Words cannot describe how I felt when they WON! I don't know if people can really understand what this means for northeast Ohio, so when I read this article and saw the pictures I said to myself: she knows, she gets it. Thanks so much for explaining it to everyone else!<br/>Darlene Bryant-Popelier", "createDate": "1466928996", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1466952144", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 68707159, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18955396", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466955744", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18955396, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
