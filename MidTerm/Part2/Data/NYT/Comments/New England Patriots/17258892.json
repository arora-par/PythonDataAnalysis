The Patriots were never found to have videotaped opponents' practices.  This is urban myth that has been perpetuated by ESPN and other news organizations with a pro-NFL or anti-Patriot agenda or merely a casual disregard for facts.  Further, the NFL did not conclude that there was a \"strong likelihood\" that Brady new about the deflation of footballs.  The conclusion of the Wells report, on which the NFL's entire case is based, was that it was \"more probable than not\" that Brady was \"generally aware\" of the tampering.  You don't need to be a lawyer to appreciate the distinction between these two standards of culpability. So, is Mr. Rhoden sloppy, biased, or both?", "createDate": "1453126806", "recommendations": 49, "updateDate": "1453128654", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56535278, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17258892", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453128654", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17258892, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
