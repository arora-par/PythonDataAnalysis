It's entirely rational to decide that his body has taken enough punishment to render him a pedestrian QB who is one devastating hit away from spending his life a cripple. What better finale for a career than being on a Superbowl championship team even if his contribution was just a bit more than zero. Some have pointed to how Ted Williams departed professional baseball with a home run in his final at bat before an almost empty Fenway Park in a losing season. Williams had been advised after the previous (1959) season to retire after hitting in the mid-200s as he dealt with a bad back. He refused and batted 314 with 29 home runs. However, Williams did not have to worry about being crippled permanently nor about CTE. He'd be a fool to come back.", "createDate": "1454978394", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1454984871", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 4383286, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17501555", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454984871", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17501555, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
