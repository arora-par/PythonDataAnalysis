If corners were adept at catching, they'd be playing wide receiver.  Their skillsets are otherwise identical.<br/><br/>Other than that, I 100% agree with your call that Green Bay should have gone for two. They had no guarantee of touching the ball again (and they didn't).  If you can potentially be put in the position of not having possession again (as overtime rules dictate), you should absolutely go for two, particularly when playing an offense like the Cardinals, for whom Carson Palmer has been playing lights out (sans Week 17).<br/><br/>A lot of commenters here are saying that the PAT was the right call, but that's demonstrably false.  Green Bay never took the field on offense again, and there was a coin flip's probability that they could be put in that position.  Given the choice, I challenge my team to win, not let a coin flip decide.", "createDate": "1453229094", "recommendations": 5, "updateDate": "1453229109", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 72972480, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17270696, "userLocation": "Tustin, CA", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17269847, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Ajab", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Agree that going for two was a good risk.
