Thanks for writing AND getting it published in the newspaper, however!<br/><br/>What an embarrassment the NFL and the Commissioner both are. I agree with some of the other commenters that the league had better be wary that Brady bringing a lawsuit. <br/><br/>Amazing how some Brady and Patriots haters like to bring up Brady's cellphone. I wasn't aware of any criminal charges being brought in deflategate, so, if Brady didn't want to hand over his cellphone to the Commissioner, why should fans feel he should be compelled to do so? He's probably hiding a girlfriend from Giselle. Give the guy a break. <br/><br/>If the league had any integrity, they'd apologize and give Brady and Kraft an award for tolerance.
