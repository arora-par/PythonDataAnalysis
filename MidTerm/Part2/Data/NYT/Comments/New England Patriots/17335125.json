So while Denver's defense may somehow stop a Panthers team that just hung 80 points on the supposedly best two teams in football (according to pre-game pundits), a Panthers team that has the unprecedented ability to run the ball most of the time and yet outscore everyone, scoring points will be a monumental task for the Broncos.
