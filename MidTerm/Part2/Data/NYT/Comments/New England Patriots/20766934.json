My kids were competitive swimmers, and the mom of a teammate spoke of her son's desire to msybe go to SUNY Maritime. I suggested he also look at USMMA, where he was admitted. The family was thrilled that I had steered their son to a free service academy. They shipped him for a year in a prep school in New Mexico. He graduated and did his service (USNR).<br/>The problem I have, and it's late in the piece, is allowing pro caliber athletes to welch on the 5 year commitment and join the reserves instead. If they take the free, not inconsiderable of cost, education, they should go the Staubach route and, you know, serve. If they're going to be allowed to slip into the reserves instead of the regular navy, they should have a 20 year commitment.", "createDate": "1481426030", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1481426978", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 34677113, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20766934", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481426978", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20766934, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
