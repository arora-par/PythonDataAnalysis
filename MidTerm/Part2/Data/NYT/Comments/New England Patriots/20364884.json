Having just visited Poland within the past month, I see a nation preserved in Baltic amber in many ways:  hating the Germans for their depredations of the 1940s, hating the Russians equally for theirs after the war, and above all, hating the evil Jews who they were taught by their parish priests were the ones who killed the Baby Jesus and put Him on the cross.
