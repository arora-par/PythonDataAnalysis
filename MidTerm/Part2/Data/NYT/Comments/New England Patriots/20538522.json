Ivanka Trump's Sending a Style Alert\"<br/><br/>This should be a clear sign in future that Donald has met with the press or possibly a visiting head of state e.g. Shinzo Abe, with Ivanka in tow at the discussions for a bit of \"product placement\" afterwards. As after the GOP Convention or the post election \"60 Minutes\" interview, style conscious Trump supporters will be offered a \"golden opportunity\" to pick up a \u20ac$10,000 gold bangle or other item from her collection.<br/><br/>With Donald Trump showing no signs of wishing to turn his business interests over to a blind trust and every sign of wishing his progeny to be intimately involved in the presidency, who knows what lies ahead. A White House shopping channel perhaps?
