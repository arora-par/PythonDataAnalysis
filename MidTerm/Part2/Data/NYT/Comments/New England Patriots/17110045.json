The only consolation in another disappointing year in Buffalo was in watching Ryan Fitzpatrick (an all world great guy, by the way, that you really want to root for) delude another city with a few tantalizing performances. Watching the 4th quarter yesterday, just as I did while watching the 4th quarter of the game in Jersey on that Thursday night in November, I kept telling the room, \"it's time for Fitz to start being Fitz\".<br/><br/>Sorry Jets fans, I think we are both dreaming, and the damn Patriots aren't going away.", "createDate": "1451913830", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1451920473", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 44461993, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17110045", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451920473", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17110045, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
