Money, profits, greed, all combined in a tight capsule where everyone of us as spectators watch the owners and their representatives forge ever<br/>larger and grandiose plans to secure their fortunes. And,ironically, with this latest debacle in St. Louis the approval from the other owners was 30 - 2 in favor of an owner who insulted a city and gave them a prominent symbolic middle finger for being unworthy to host an NFL team as he exited.  That is the measure of success they aspire to on their way to a global sport where we're seeing only the beginnings of their expansion vision. Little guys be damned.", "createDate": "1452782330", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1452791898", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 2532846, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17220925", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452791898", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17220925, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
