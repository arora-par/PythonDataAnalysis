It's nothing new.  The Whig Party was the first example of a failed party, and now the GOP is faced with the monster that they've created with their do-nothing intransigence.   It's a self-inflicted wound that is the direct result of the poisonous rhetoric that the Republicans have used in their attempts to destroy the democratic institutions of America.<br/>Maybe when the smoke clears from the ashes of the former party of Lincoln, they'll realize what they've done with their know-nothing, do nothing strategy aimed at the poorly educated and gullible people of America.<br/>Wrapping yourself in a flag and calling yourself a patriot while hacking away at America's institutions doesn't really work in the long run.  The billionaire funders of the GOP are morally bankrupt, like the party they own.", "createDate": "1466343980", "recommendations": 322, "updateDate": "1466341454", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 73282552, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18889057:18889410", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466345054", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "blackmamba", "commentID": 18889410, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": true}
