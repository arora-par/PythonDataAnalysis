Can a dead horse be beat any more?<br/><br/>As a lifelong Patriots fan, all the talk and articles about Patriots and cheating are  just that, talk.<br/><br/>Sure, there was SpyGate where the Patriots had been caught videotaping signals hundreds of other people could see, no doubt about that.<br/><br/>But what about the predictions on how the Patriots would have a high number of fumbles and interceptions this year because of their \"cheating\" with PSI levels?  <br/><br/>Didn't happen, right?<br/><br/>Please keep writing these articles about Patriots and cheating, they'll just do what they've always done: out coach, out prepare and out execute the other teams and compete every year for the championship.<br/><br/>And when they lose, they'll be the first to say it: the other team out played and out coached us.", "createDate": "1453033864", "recommendations": 19, "updateDate": "1453051804", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 65468241, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6546/8241/cropped-65468241.jpg?0.7182554090421214", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17254187, "userLocation": "excramento", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17250765, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "cfb cfb", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "There are some good tidbits.  Look up the article where Eric Mangini says he regrets ratting out the Patriots on spygate.  He says he never thought it'd be made into a big deal and feels it gave no competitive advantage.  Or read the comments made by Jimmy Johnson where he said his Cowboys teams taped everything the opponents did, but felt it was little more than a distraction.<br/><br/>Then watch ESPN's Sports Science Deflategate video.  Where they use real science and measurements to conclude that a 2lb deflated ball offered no competitive advantage. Only 1 of 12 Patriots balls was deflated by 2lbs.
