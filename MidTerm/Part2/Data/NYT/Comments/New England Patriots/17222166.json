The whole thing is being privately financed. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it's stunning how community leaders across the country (Oakland, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Denver, Dallas, Charlotte, etc., etc., will happily indebt their citizens in exchange for an NFL franchise. Not only is it unfair for folks who don't give a darn about pro football, it's plainly (as in the case of St. Louis and Oakland) a horrible investment. <br/><br/>Investing in pro sports, particularly the NFL has become a case of extortion on the part of owners. People should understand that. <br/><br/>Los Angeles certainly did.
