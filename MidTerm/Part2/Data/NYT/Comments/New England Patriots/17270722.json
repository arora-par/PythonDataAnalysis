What not let them see both teams (their team and the other team) on offense in OT, especially playoff OT? Why cut it short of that?  If both teams get a chance on offense, or at least a chance to field a kickoff to them, the coin toss is then much less important.  And the game should be more important than a lame, childish flip of a coin. <br/><br/>But definitely no college OT system.  That is not much better than penalty kick endings in soccer. Let's have punts and kickoffs in OT.  Let's have real football decide the contest.
