But if Hillary wins PA, NH, and FL before then, it'll be a foregone conclusion.  <br/><br/>But whomever wins, I can only hope that the losing candidate is gracious in accepting the outcome and we can put the bitterness behind us as best we can and work together.  There is more that unites us than divides us - our nation is one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
