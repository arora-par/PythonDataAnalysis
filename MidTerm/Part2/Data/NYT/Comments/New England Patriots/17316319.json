Most tried cases are circumstantial.  For those cases where direct evidence exists, it usual behooves one party or the other to dismiss or settle.  As a federal prosecutor, I tried 70 cases from the first chair (a lot, but certainly no record)...I'd estimate that two-thirds, maybe three-quarters, of those were circumstantial cases.  My colleagues were no different.<br/><br/>Also, that you note that the the court's decision relied on a procedural issue under the bargaining agreement  (i.e., insufficiency of notice) and not the substance of the accusation (i.e., that Brady, et al., deflated the balls) doesn't make the assertions any less compelling.  Indeed, that Brady and the Pats won on a non-substantive point would seem to do just the opposite....it leaves open and unresolved the ultimate question regarding guilt.", "createDate": "1453583360", "recommendations": 13, "updateDate": "1453584543", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 67446284, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17316698, "userLocation": "Boston", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17316319, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Burned in Boston", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "As a federal prosecutor, maybe you can clarify some things for me.  This case seems to have scientific evidence that the balls were not tampered with.  I.e. the inflation level can be explained by the cold temperature.  Once we understand this what difference does any other circumstantial evidence make if there is no evidence of an infraction in the first place?<br/><br/>You are correct that the Federal judge did not rule on the question of guilt.  What he did rule on was that the process used by the NFL to determine guilt was a fundamentally unfair process.  So we have a situation where the scientific evidence shows no evidence of an infraction and the process used to find guilt was fundamentally unfair.   In that case, as a federal prosecutor, wouldn't you say that Brady deserves the benefit of the doubt and she be considered not guilty?", "createDate": "1453587453", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1453610353", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 2192910, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17316319:17316698", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453610353", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Rex Vasily", "commentID": 17316698, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17316882, "userLocation": "Rye", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17316319, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "CK", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Reply to Rex Vasily Connecticut -<br/>It's not even a circumstantial case in fact the evidence supports the Patriots as truthful by way of clear evidence.
