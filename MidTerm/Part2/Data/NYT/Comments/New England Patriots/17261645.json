I give him credit for that. I think that his work ethic derives from his father and the exposure to the culture at the USNA.<br/><br/>During his time in CLE always thought that there was a nicer, decent person, behind all of the tough guy stuff. I realize this is very late to the party but I am sorry he got divorced. Debby Belichick seemed to be, and is, a really nice person.<br/><br/>The business with the taping bothered me. The air pressure stuff was just anothe example of the NFL's arrogance and cluelessness.<br/><br/>If Bill Belichick ran the NYTimes Mr. Rhoden wouldn't even be on the roster or have any other kind of job...especially one that involved writing. BB didn't get to where he is by tolerating mediocrity.", "createDate": "1453147287", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1453157249", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 7070333, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17261645", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453157249", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17261645, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
