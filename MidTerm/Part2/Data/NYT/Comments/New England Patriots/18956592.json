I moved with my family to Athens, Ohio from the very far away Chile.  I had no idea about (american) football or basketball, and knew very little about baseball.  In Athens, it was all about the Cincinnati Reds. We moved to Columbus in '75, then started at Ohio State in '78 - that is when I met the Cleveland fans!  They were so much fun, yet so down to earth.  In those days, the Indians were really bad, but my Cleveland friends supported them no matter what! They were so positive and optimistic, even though their home city teams were not so good.  To this day, I will cheer for any Cleveland team over any other team...plus Ohio State and the Chilean National Futbol (soccer) team of course.  Thank you for the memories.", "createDate": "1466944433", "recommendations": 9, "updateDate": "1466952160", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 3865832, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18956592", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466955760", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18956592, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
