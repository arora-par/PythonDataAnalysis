He failed mostly because he has been too impulsive &amp; reckless.<br/><br/>He does have about 80% of the clinical symptoms of hypomania. (I happen to be a psychiatrist &amp; 80 yrs. old) If he were a little less so, and only a hypomanic personality as many successful businessmen &amp; statesmen have been, he could have achieved anything he set out to achieve. Two good examples of hypomanic personality have been Bill Clinton &amp; Fidel Castro. Fidel Castro had enormous charisma; Bill Clinton had a lot less. Still Clinton's indefatigable persistence &amp; laser-focus on what he wanted to achieve &amp; humility made him quite successful. All three, Trump, Clinton &amp; Castro are exceptionally gifted. In general, with liberal margins, all three are essentially benevolent men.<br/><br/>Because of his hypomania, the nation should not take a chance on Trump. Impulsive mistakes he is likely to make, if he becomes president, COULD, though not necessarily be DISASTROUS.
