In summary, they have to start all over, &amp; pick the best athletes in the draft, &amp; buy the best athletes whose contracts are up.The only one I would keep is Powell the Full Back, who should have been used more.", "createDate": "1482675059", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1482686862", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56907400, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20906610", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1482686862", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20906610, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
