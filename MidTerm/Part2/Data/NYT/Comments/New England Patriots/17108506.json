You just learned the hard way that Fitz always, always, always chokes when it matters most.  He can't help himself.  He thinks his intelligence will overcome his lack of arm strength and he throws picks.  It's why we cut him in 2012 and wasted a draft pick on EJ Manuel in a bad QB draft class.  Fitz is a great guy and he will win you some games, but he's not now or has he ever been a starter in the NFL.<br/><br/>Personally though I hope you bring him back next year because, as Bills fans know, it will happen again.<br/><br/>GO BILLS!!!", "createDate": "1451879450", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1451880845", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 71300954, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17110993, "userLocation": "NY, NY", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17108506, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "SJG", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "The thing to remember about Fitzpatrick is that the Jets didn't pursue him with any great expectations. They signed him because they needed a quarterback. Fewer than half the teams in the NFL have the type of QB that you get excited about. The rest do the best they can to build a team and find a QB that isn't going to screw it up. In the end, Fitz was awful in the 4th quarter but he avoided that type of play for most of the season which is really more than you can expect when you're not one of the teams with the top 10-15 QBs.", "createDate": "1451918655", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1451920570", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 4385033, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17108506:17110993", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451920570", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Scott R", "commentID": 17110993, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17111326, "userLocation": "New Jersy", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17108506, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Ultraliberal", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Scott,<br/>        The Jets knew that Fitzpatrick would choke, thats why they acquired him.<br/>Jet Fans are Masachists thats why we follow them, we are also Met Fans, &amp; Net Fans, there is something about Three letter teams that excite us.We generally get nervous when our teams win , but are totally relaxed when they lose.I should also mention, we also spend millions on the lottery, &amp; to my knowledge, no one who roots for the above disasters ever won.I can't wait until next year, the depression is wearing off.", "createDate": "1451920417", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1451920610", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 56907400, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17108506:17111326", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451920610", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Scott R", "commentID": 17111326, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17108506", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451880845", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17108506, "replyCount": 2, "editorsSelection": false}
