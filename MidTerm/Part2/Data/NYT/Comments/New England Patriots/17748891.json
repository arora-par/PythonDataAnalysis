Yes,of course MA has Republiican voters, and they are, for the most part, as ignorant and bigoted as those in the reddest states of the deep South.  But so what? They 're Republicans, and in MA,  \"real\" Republicans, not the moderates named in this article,  are as rare there as liberals in Alabama or South Carolina.  So Trump may win that primary and that may help him, not a lot but a little,, to get thhe Repub. nomination. But no one in his/her right mind expects him to win MA in November. <br/><br/>So this exercise in idle speculation is wworthlesss.  I don;t know why the writer bothered to write it or the NYT's editor printed it.<br/><br/>But, when Trump says, \u201cI love the poorly educated!\u201d, we can believe him.  Because he's talking about himself and he certainly does love himself.", "createDate": "1456855122", "recommendations": 11, "updateDate": "1456855821", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 53949914, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17827890, "userLocation": "Boston MA", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17748891, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "DaveB", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Agreed.
