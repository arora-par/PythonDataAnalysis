Despite that, he has worked incredibly hard for decades to stay at the top of his game. And we think we offer new insights to him about how hard he'll have to work and what risks he is taking, and that we're in a position to tell him he's had enough? That hubris is ours, not his.<br/><br/>I'm guessing he wouldn't trade anything for the experiences he's had; otherwise he would have. He had the choice to exit, and the means to do it, yet didn't.<br/><br/>His career will end, as all do, at the moment when he, his teams, or both decide he no longer meets the measure of a top-flight quarterback in the NFL. I'm guessing we all witnessed that moment pass this season. As a long-time Broncos fan, often victimized by a younger Manning, I'm so happy for the team and for him that the team was able to carry him to a victory yesterday that was very sweet and is so rare.", "createDate": "1454959164", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1454966063", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 73623508, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17498424", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454966063", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17498424, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
