Another way of looking at it is that in a single elimination playoff format, the outcome of any one game has miserable statistical significance. The net result is that whoever ends up in the Super Bowl and which of the contestants wins it, is as much a champion by dint of luck as much as skill. It would be nice if football matches, at least in the post season, were a best of three, or best of five, format, but the game is so brutally punishing on players that that will never happen. I love watching the game (I am a Seahawks fan) but I have given up on reading too much into the outcome of those games.", "createDate": "1452719449", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1452723387", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 51477244, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/5147/7244/cropped-51477244.jpg?267127480521665413", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17214653", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452723387", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17214653, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
