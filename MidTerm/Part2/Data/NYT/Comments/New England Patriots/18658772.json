David was skilled (with his slingshot) and confident in His God. He did not just boast of defeating Goliath but went ahead and showed them all. Goliath thought he \"won\" even though there was no fight; when the fight actually happened, he lost to David.<br/><br/>I cannot equate GSW with Goliath; they are more like David. Goliath was plain talk with nothing to show. The Warriors have fought and won, many times. And they're in the fight still. :)", "createDate": "1464321675", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1464320896", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 75711435, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18658772", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1464324496", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18658772, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
