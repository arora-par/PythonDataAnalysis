Our office is currently planning to stay open, but there's serious concerns over violence and damage to our building and our employees. We were fortunate that the Cavs' parade went relatively smoothly, but that was a happy event for all in attendance. <br/><br/>This convention seems like an event where nobody, including the delegates, are happy about the state of affairs. Throw into the mix, the fact that Ohio is an open-carry state and we've got a recipe for disaster. Sadly, most of my friends and colleagues agree that it's a matter of when something tragic occurs, and not if.
