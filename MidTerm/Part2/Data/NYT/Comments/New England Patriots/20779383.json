Keep in mind that the prep school kid still has four years of education at a military academy while the regular college can play in his fifth year with almost no academic load.  I do believe that a military academy grad who does not have to fulfill his/her five years of active duty should reimburse the government for his education out of his million dollar pro bonus.  Note that Forbes lists the academies as the top three liberal arts schools in the country.  That does not come from football.", "createDate": "1481554816", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1481561289", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 78170014, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20779383", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481561289", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20779383, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
