Or the Lakers or Blue Devils of football: pick your pretty team that people love to love and love to hate. Too many wins, too many bandwagon fans, and too many supermodel girlfriends/wives. And like the above teams, they were good enough to earn it.<br/><br/>It was a nice run, and the Denver defense ended it. A lot has been said about Manning's season and the nature of this rivalry. But maybe Tom Brady is also getting a bit old? He feels like Jeter, not quite pulling another one out of the bag. Now that the dynasty is over, to whom do we turn to hate like we hated the Patriots?  Or to turn that question around, to whom do the bandwagon fans outside New England turn to now? The Yankees aren't good, Kobe is awful and retiring, and Duke might not be all that this year.", "createDate": "1453754844", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453759732", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 68409180, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17335630", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453759732", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17335630, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
