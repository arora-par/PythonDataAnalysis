Countless front page articles on wage disparity and systemic racism by police and this is the best you can do-- shaming Mr. Goodell for his earnings?  How about a piece on the fiction that is Peyton Manning and the institutionalized racism that doesn't hesitate to destroy a black player while propping and protecting the white ones.  How about writing  an honest condemnation of the mainstream media, now evidenced to have protected Mr. manning while lynching black players for much of the same behavior.   How about writing about how the NFL buried a helmet manufacturing enterprise for the very technology it sought, now the lame duck headed for bankruptcy, its workers paying the price for concussions caused by the player's union and the NFL's failure to protect its greatest asset-- the players.  Mr. Goodell's earnings, while distasteful, are merely indicative of his value as a pawn, a red herring intended to detract from the real bad actors of football.  Show some editorial integrity and write about something other than a windfall and some pure breed dogs.", "createDate": "1455716151", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1455725594", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 73980455, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17603016, "userLocation": "Florida", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17596936, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Lizabeth", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Hey!
