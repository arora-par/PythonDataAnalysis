It is plain disgusting to think that a military academy funded by tax dollars has as its goal to win on the field of sports as if it was relevant to anything.  Sports are a mindless  activity once you take it beyond the idea of fitness.  The mania for sports team as a primary community value is as primitive and absurd as Roman Gladiators.  Go do it but don't make it central to identity and a prime measure of human achievement.  You end up like the Russians: anything to win, corruption acceptable.
