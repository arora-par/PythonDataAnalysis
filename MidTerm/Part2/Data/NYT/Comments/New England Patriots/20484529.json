This kind of accusation and denial is not fair to Bannon, his accusers or defenders.  <br/><br/>Instead, report on what statements or actions  make people think that he is anti-Semitic and/or racists.  Then his defenders can defend, and people can make their own judgments.<br/><br/>Of course, backing a candidate who did nothing to stop the vile comments from crowds at his rallies and encouraged targeting of reporters could lend some credence to such charges.  On the other hand, maybe Conway and Bannon tried to encourage their candidate to display leadership.", "createDate": "1479166791", "recommendations": 102, "updateDate": "1479218805", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 47349721, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4734/9721/cropped-47349721.jpg?0.17552296142093837", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20484529", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1479166809", "trusted": 1, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20484529, "replyCount": 14, "editorsSelection": true}
