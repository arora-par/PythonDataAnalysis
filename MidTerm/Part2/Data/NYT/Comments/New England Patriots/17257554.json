Could you imagine the Watergate style investigation of there were allegations that Gisele was reviving suspicious packages all over the place for her husband? People don't typically make those sorts of allegations in this age of lawsuits if there is not some truth.<br/>I hope NE crushes Denver.<br/>The NFL suspended Brady based on a flimsy report that basically boiled down to \"um, we think he might have done it. We have no proof but let's ruined the guys career anyway.\" Meanwhile, it would be a lot easier to investigate packages sent to Mrs. Manning. Apparently the NFL has never ordered a package online.

Man, the Pats seemed to know everything the Rams were going to do....oh, that's right, they had video'd the Rams' workouts. Got caught again with the Jets in 2007. There were some fines that sounded lofty unless you consider that it was multimillionaires that were being fined. The taped evidence was then destroyed. The Pats should have had victories taken away and personnel permanently banned from the game. No, there wasn't much to \"Deflate-gate.\" The worst part of it is that it gave Pats fans cover to claim persecution from the same NFL that dropped the ball when they had the Pats dead-to-rights.
