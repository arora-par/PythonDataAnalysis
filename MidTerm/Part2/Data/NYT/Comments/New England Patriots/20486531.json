None that I know but I would bet even some nearby neighbors did.<br/><br/>And the ones who voted for this team of defilers, who do not consider themselves racist - don't they know that supporting people who have said these things is a stab in the back and heart to all the people who had Trump's venom and lies cast upon them?   That they give all of that hate their tacit support?!<br/><br/>We owed our fellow citizens and every other human on this planet a big push against Trump and his gang.
