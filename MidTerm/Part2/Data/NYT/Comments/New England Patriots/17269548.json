As a Cardinal fan, the play reminded me of Rothelsberg's last second pass against the Cards in the Superbowl.  After the Rodger's Hail Mary I was sure that again, in the last seconds, my team would loose. But, wonders of wonders Green Bay left Superman Larry Fitzgerald wide open for his 75 yard run.  Then Coach Ariens went back in time for an olf fashioned shovel pass to Fitzgerald to win the game!  Roll on Sunday.  By the way the state of the Carolina field was a disgrace, don't you think?", "createDate": "1453227858", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1453228280", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 7300926, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17269548", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453228280", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17269548, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
