Three dropped passes in four downs is not so great when the passes were all spot on. It is not the Manning of old but he is still one of the top QB's in the game. If their receivers can't hold onto the ball, I am not sure they can get past New England again. Manning should be rested and healthy so who knows.  Maybe New England will get caught cheating before the week is over.
