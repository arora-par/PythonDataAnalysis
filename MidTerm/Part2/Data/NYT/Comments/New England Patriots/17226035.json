Lynch's absence has forced Bevel and Wilson to throw more. And this has helped Wilson become an Elite pocket passer, maybe the best in the NFL, better than Newton, statistically in the last half of the season. It will be a close game. The Hawks will remember the earlier game this season, and how they got burned in the final minutes with Newton pass to the TE for the win. That game was close. The Hawks could have won that. My prediction: Seahawks 27, Panthers 24...Hawks win in overtime.
