He led with his shoulder and hit a player that had already turned and taken multiple steps.  It was textbook hit.  The \"defenseless player' rule is the most poorly interpreted call in football.  It is NEVER called based on the action of the striking player but is always flagged based on the reaction of the player being hit.   It needs to be eliminated or at the very least completely redefined.", "createDate": "1452891896", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452895542", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74034338, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17237873", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452895542", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17237873, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
