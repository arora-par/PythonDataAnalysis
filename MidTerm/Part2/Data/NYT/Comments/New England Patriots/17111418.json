Watching the dropped balls and a QB then desperate to make something happen was like watching a traffic accident. The penalties showed more than ever the Ryan legacy lives on, one dumb mistake after another. There is significant talent on the Jets, I like the ability of the receivers and I think Fitzpatrick is very underrated but without some game discipline and gaps in game sanity: the Jets will never make the top. <br/><br/>Bills fans, congratulations on the 8 -8  season. Were I you I'd celebrate it, because the next 4 years under Ryan will crush your spirit more than you can imagine:). Great spoiler never a champion.
