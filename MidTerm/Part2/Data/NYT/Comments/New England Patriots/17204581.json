The NFL has the highest rate of return of virtually all investments. But, the general public isn't allowed to invest, of course.<br/><br/>That average Americans aren't even allowed to invest is appalling enough (an increasing problem in the larger marketplace), but that the NFL makes billions off taxpayer shakedowns, and that the NFL is an unregulated monopoly, exempted by federal law, is triple appalling. <br/><br/>Green Bay had it right. Cities should be able to buy and own their own sports teams. But because the NFL hates that model (and secretly despises Green Bay's perennial success), they will never allow another team to be owned by a city. <br/><br/>Strip the NFL's antitrust exemption now. These owners are billionaire monopolists conspiring against taxpayers within a cartel. How totally Un-American. The U.S. military should refuse flyovers.
