We also live at a time when a member of the House of Representatives from a Southern state shouts \"You lie!\" at the first African American president during a televised State of the Union speech. <br/><br/>Sexist and racist bullying has become entrenched as a way of life. I commend these two women journalists for speaking out. <br/><br/>We've let the worst among us - the angry, the insecure and the unstable - run amok. Enough already. Let's truly make America great again by reinstating civil discourse and reasoned debate.
