Take this from a University of Utah grad who cheers for Alex Smith and the Chiefs. Alex Smith, a former Utah Ute, is great. No doubt. And I was rooting for him and the Chiefs tonight. But when it comes to greatness, I must sweep away my bias to see true greatness. And Tom Brady is a great quarterback. If you can put passes on the money, or numbers, it doesn't matter how inflated or deflated the ball is. It just is. And you are just you.
