There is little talk of honors for Bowles.  The Jets defense was the key to their success.  Bowles is responsible for pretty much all the defensive formations and play calls.  Maccagan brought in the cornerbacks and Fitzpatrick.  The Jets' passing defense was very good, but they had the best rushing defense in the league -- which has a lot more to do with the front 7 than the cornerbacks.  As for Fitzpatrick, his career won-loss record is abysmal.  Bowles got to 10-6 nonetheless.  Bowles is not a self-promoter, but he's the guy who is most responsible for turning the Jets around this year.", "createDate": "1451880459", "recommendations": 6, "updateDate": "1451880850", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 48147869, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4814/7869/cropped-48147869.jpg?1475980521793890914", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17108575", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451880850", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17108575, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
