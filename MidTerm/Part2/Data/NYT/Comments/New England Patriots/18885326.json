McConnell should do the same.  Unfortunately, neither of these politicians appears to have really grasped what caused the rise of Trump - and that they are directly culpable given their ole in  GOP obstructionism, policies that do not benefit ordinary citizens, the veiled racism toward President Obama, and the vilification of Government in general all contributed to the climate that saw the rise of Trump.  Let's be honest - Gingrich and Christie hitched themselves to Trump as a last gasp attempt to be politically relevant.   Watching the GOP leadership twist in the wind would be entertaining if the damage to the nation having Trump as a nominee of a major political party weren't so dangerous.  I certainly hope the TV coverage of the GOP circus will be seriously curtailed, as there will be no real news or policy coming out of the convention.   The only thing we apparently have to look forward to is Trump, Trump, Trump, and oh, more Trump.", "createDate": "1466290187", "recommendations": 597, "updateDate": "1466344444", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 65160147, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18885326", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466290208", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18885326, "replyCount": 2, "editorsSelection": true}
