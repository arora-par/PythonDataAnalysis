There is nothing like \"OVER CONFIDENCE\" to throw a very large wrench into the works! Cam Newton will lead his young studs into the super bowl ready to beat this \"old man\" within an inch of his life ... and therein lays the trap. If yesterday proved anything, it proved you don't have to have the strongest arm or the wizard of a coach or even a running game for the ages. What you do need frequently in times like these is EXPERIENCE, POISE AND SKILL SETS to overcome the youth and virility that is coming at you from all angles ... and Peyton Manning possesses all of those attributes and more. The Carolina Panthers will have to prove they have grown up two Sunday's from now if they want to go back to Charlotte with a trophy. Bring on Super Bowl 50 ... it's gonna be a game for the ages!", "createDate": "1453748448", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1453753062", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 64644477, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17334256", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453753062", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17334256, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
