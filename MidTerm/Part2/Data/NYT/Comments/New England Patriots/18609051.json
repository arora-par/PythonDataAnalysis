Instead of finding an intelligent and factual article to enjoy, I find this long-winded, opinionated, frivolous bias. Draper's imagined Trump World, complaint about Trump's engaging an experienced political campaign adviser (Manafort) in lieu of an outsider to politics, and criticism of the Fl. State attorney for not prosecuting Lewandowski are so nonsensical. Draper is clueless of who his readers are.", "createDate": "1463969079", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1464024692", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74498025, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18609051", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1464028292", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18609051, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
