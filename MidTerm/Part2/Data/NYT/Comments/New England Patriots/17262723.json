Some veterans come from elsewhere to \"fit in\" getting a reprise on an unglorious career.  The coaches are terrific and the players buying into the system.  We want a Super Bowl title, but in the end, we really want a game well played.  If they lose to Denver because Payton is playing at his best, then so be it.  The Denver defense is terrific.  Can they stop Brady?  Maybe.  But that's what makes sport.  A battle between very good teams and players.  Guys on both sides who want to play, want to improve, want to win.  Can it get any better than that?", "createDate": "1453164150", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1453219063", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 2201985, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17262723", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453219063", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17262723, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
