In those days its mission was to give a refresher to enlisted personnel who had been in the fleet for several years although I had just graduated and just \"feel into\" the program.  So it appears that NAPS is now a variant of affirmative action however it does not mention that these people have to pass the same academic and other programs that everyone else has to and get the same five year commitment to serve with some exceptions (those should be eliminated) but the others have passed one the most rigorous college experiences of any and pay with five years of service so my conclusion is that the country is still best served with the exception of those enlisted who were denied an admission but would have been accepted in the past...............life is never fair is it?", "createDate": "1481425520", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1481426956", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 114105, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20766884", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1481426956", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20766884, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
