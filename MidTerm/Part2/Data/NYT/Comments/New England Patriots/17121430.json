Bad 4th quarter decisions and failing to cool off OBJ in the Panther game are definitely shortcomings of this past season.  Especially, from a veteran who should give you an advantage in those situations.  With that being said, the Giants will not find a better coach.  <br/><br/>My big question, is why does Jerry Reese have a free pass.  Not since 2007 has he made any significant draft picks past round 1.  He is awful and deserves the blame.  The linebackers, offensive line, secondary, and overall depth were awful.  <br/><br/>While his gameday decisions can be criticized, with the talent he had, Coughlin prepped the team phenomenally!!!   The problem is Reese, and that will become clearer without Coughlin.", "createDate": "1452003430", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1452009716", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 67319886, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17123033, "userLocation": "<br/>", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17121430, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "adrienne rourke", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Could not agree with you more,  all NYG fans feel that Mr. Reese should go.

They got hot, and against N.E. they got lucky, with Tyree and Manningham making fabulous catches. Reese didn't draft those teams. But he did draft the team that lost SIX games in the last 75 seconds, as the articles attests. Had they won those games, had they not made boneheaded plays and decisions on the field, their record would have been 12-6. Reeses doesn't call time outs. He doesn't tell players not to score and then throw the ball out of bounds. The players were good enough to win, if the coaches and Manning didn't let their little minds get in the way.", "createDate": "1452017348", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452025246", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 12784038, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17121430:17124976", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452025246", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Patrick", "commentID": 17124976, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}], "permID": "17121430", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452009716", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17121430, "replyCount": 2, "editorsSelection": false}
