The box score doesn't show the grit of the team. <br/><br/>This is the only team in football, where the QB misses the snap, and all the fans jump up off the couch in excitement. This is the only team in football where the score is 0-24, and all the fans think: \"we'll probably win.\" <br/><br/>Being in New York, the simple fact is that no east coast fans know enough about the NFC west to even evaluate our position. They're too busy complaining about the Jets, the Giants, the Patriots. Even Green Bay seems exotic. <br/><br/>Against the Panthers in the last 4 years we're 4-1, and three of those games were in Carolina.  <br/><br/>We're the #1 Defense, four years in a row. We've been to the playoffs 5 out of the last 6 years.
