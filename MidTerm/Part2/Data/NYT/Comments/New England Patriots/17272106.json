If instead they go with the 2 point conversion, it's 48%. Only an ignoramus would count those odds as appreciably different on a one-off play like this, in which the season was at stake. If one is looking for a reason to go with the PAT and overtime, it would be that the Packers would certainly seem to have major momentum going on their side.<br/><br/>By any rational reckoning, whatever went wrong for the Packers went wrong in overtime itself.<br/><br/>Why try to turn a decision that couldn't have been more obviously 6 of one and a half dozen of the other into some stupendous mistake?<br/><br/>Again, only an ignoramus would try to do that.", "createDate": "1453240860", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1453240870", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 28047160, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17305963, "userLocation": "Minneapolis", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17272106, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Ryan Curry", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Except it's not multiplied by .5 as you posit since road teams win only .45 of OT's historically.  And factoring in the fact that the league wide average of 48% for 2 pt. conversions is sampled from mostly bad teams that are playing from behind (winning record teams have an average 2 pt. conversion rate over 50%) the difference is closer to an 8% overall difference.  Maybe still small but by no means worthy of ignoramus name calling.  If a coach can easily improve his teams chance of winning by over 8% that's not peanuts and should not be ignored.  And quibble if you will whether its 8% or 6% but it's not 1%.  There is something to home field advantage across all sports and that counts in OT too.
