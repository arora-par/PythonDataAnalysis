Denver has played at least 5 games this season with similar second half impotence. While Manning was better in this game than he has been all season, he had little chance in the second half because all his passes were on \"must pass\" situations. Without Wade Phillips' defense, Denver would have been maybe 3-13.<br/><br/>Congrats to a defense that may be the best the NFL has seen since the Ravens in 2000.", "createDate": "1453770019", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1453783260", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 25640399, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17338706", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453783260", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17338706, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
