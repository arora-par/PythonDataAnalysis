Carolina, you don't like sports\".<br/>You laud development of civic spirit, learning teamwork &amp; self-discipline &amp; enhanced college admission possibilities.<br/>I love participatory sports, especially the ones modeled by my parents, most of which require teamwork, discipline &amp; practice, such as running, tennis, swimming, diving, Pony-Clubbing, beagling, lacrosse, soccer &amp; skiing.<br/>Helmets are not the problem.
