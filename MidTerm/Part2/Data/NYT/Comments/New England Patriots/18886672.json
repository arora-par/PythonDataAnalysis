We now talk Trump all the time and not the GOP's disastrous policies for this country. <br/><br/>The GOP still want to cut taxes for the 1% while refusing investment in infrastructure, R&amp;D and education. They think global warming is a hoax and businesses can self-regulate themselves in environmental and consumer protection. They are for telling women when to have babies while refusing them help. They are for religious liberty only when one is a Christian against LGBT. So goes the list....<br/><br/>In a round about way, Trump is actually good for the GOP; because by focusing on him, we forget how the GOP is even more corrupt and dysfunctional than their  brainchild, protege, Trump. At least Trump defrauded just a small number of business investors and Trump University students infatuated enough with his flashy personality to be fooled by him. The GOP has fooled and conned and defrauded the whole country and all Americans in their capacity as one of the two major party of this country.", "createDate": "1466304022", "recommendations": 786, "updateDate": "1466344394", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 58457232, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18886672", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466304068", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18886672, "replyCount": 1, "editorsSelection": true}
