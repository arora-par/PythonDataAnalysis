Football stats should be viewed in context of the players and opponents. Normally, anyone would take Aaron Rodgers over Carson Palmer in pressure situations, especially after that amazing performance to tie the game. But Rodgers has been particularly cursed in OT. Going into the Arizona game he was 0-6-1 in all OT games and 0-2 in OT playoff games. <br/><br/>Even so, the only thing Rodgers did wrong was call \"tails\" at the start of overtime. If he had called heads and the team marched down and scored, there'd be no column. Which really makes the second-guessing in this case rather uninspired writing. C'mon TMQ, go bold!", "createDate": "1453249093", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453254276", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 16946662, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17273327", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453254276", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17273327, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
