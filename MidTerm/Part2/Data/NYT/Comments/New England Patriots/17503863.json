He made watching each game exciting. I would be on pins and needles when he got the ball, not knowing what to expect!!! I'm going to miss being able to yell B-E-A-S-T-M-O-D-E!!! I so wanted him to play in another Super Bowl for the Seahawks and get another ring and hopefully become MVP because we Seahawks know he can do it and deserves it! I don't like it, but I understand! What good is money or all the riches in the world, if you are all beat up and run down??? Sometimes, change is good, even when it makes you sad.  It will take some getting used to, but Life will go on for Marshawn as well as for the Seahawks.  May he continue to prosper and Be Blessed. Now I gotta go out and buy a new shirt.", "createDate": "1455001576", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1455046870", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74340411, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17503863", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455046870", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17503863, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
