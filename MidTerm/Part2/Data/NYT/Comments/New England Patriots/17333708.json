Tom Brady  &amp; Peyton Manning's time as the premier NFL QBs has come and gone.   Ego, discipline and obsessive training will not counter the younger, stronger &amp; just as highly talented i.e. Cam Newton, Russell Wilson. <br/><br/>I believe Manning will retire after this (he should) . . . but Brady will stumble on, drinking the \"kool-aid\" of his paid swamis.  Please, please save the embarrassment -- if not for yourself . . .  then, for us  !!! <br/><br/>As far as SB50, it needn't be a blow-out.  If only the Broncos had two significant running backs.  The ground game delivered by Anderson &amp; Hillman is shockingly subpar. Both 24 years old and they run with the power &amp; agility of my 85 year old mother !    Have some pride, pull up your straps, hit those holes with HEAT  . . . or do you just like depending on your team's good defense to be your saviour momma ?", "createDate": "1453746377", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453752908", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 66948883, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17333708", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453752908", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17333708, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
