And he is married to Giselle, an even more famous person.   Perhaps he was protecting his privacy in other matters.  I can't find him guilty for that act.  I would absolutely do the same thing and face whatever the consequences if I felt that my privacy was about to be invaded.  As for the science behind it, if it is proven as possible that he didn't do it, how can you find him guilty of doing it?  Seems that science isn't respected in the courts of football, nor is proving guilt.  It's apparently enough to just declare it so.", "createDate": "1461625153", "recommendations": 12, "updateDate": "1461638146", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 69261150, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18328745", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1461625977", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18328745, "replyCount": 3, "editorsSelection": true}
