No guarantees about Warriors next season. I suspect KD got some bad advice and the Thunder just did not want to meet his price. Also, the Thunder may actually want to keep Russell Westbrook and now they have the money to do that. They also might have mentioned to KD that despite one trip to the finals-they were beaten easily by Heat. They should have been in the Finals this year and would have had a very good shot at beating the Cavs. Fail again. Most of that on KD. Thunder still have a good team, all they need is a scoring forward or someone like Monta Ellis. KD should have stayed in OKC. Never have a fan base like that again. Never have a teammate like Russell Westbrook again.", "createDate": "1467738033", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1467738758", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 27368928, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "19047083", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1467742358", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 19047083, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
