And yesterday it hurt - I can't really say why, because I should have known once my little daughter asked my who I thought would win and I couldn't bring myself to answer. When it was over I sat there and was actually heartbrocken.<br/>And I already know I will be back next season  ... and I will keep coming back and cheer at my screen from 11.000 miles away - thank you for a great ride and an amazingly entertaining  season when I was proud to be a Jet Fan! I love you guys - see in the Fall (or Pro Bowl) !", "createDate": "1451926763", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1451928327", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 73879228, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17112842", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451928327", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17112842, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
