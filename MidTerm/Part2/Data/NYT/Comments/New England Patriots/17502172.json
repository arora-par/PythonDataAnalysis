His last two games, most specifically the one against the Patriots, highlighted his ability and intelligence, factors that his soon-to-be successor could not have brought to bear at this point and which sparked the faltering Denver offense. This game was not his and he of all people would be the first to acknowledge that... a team player to the end. Thanks for the ride Peyton. Hope you continue to be a presence in some coaching or consultant capacity.", "createDate": "1454982815", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1454984871", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 62766974, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6276/6974/cropped-62766974.jpg?0.5176322121166395", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17502172", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454984871", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17502172, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
