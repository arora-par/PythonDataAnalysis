All scores have to be reviewed, for instance. It's made a overly long, disjointed telecast even less tolerable.<br/>In contrast, baseball has only the team challenge, and reviews are handled quickly by experts in a studio with the best technology. And we all benefit from rarely seeing the futile, and often degrading, spectacle of a manager arguing calls with the umpire. I think baseball has the technology about right.", "createDate": "1462481616", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1462478369", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 878415, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18436123", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462481969", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18436123, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
