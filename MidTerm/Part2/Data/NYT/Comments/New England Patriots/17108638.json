Last week, I predicted that the Jets would miss the playoffs at 10-6. The part where the Steelers would win against the lowly Browns was easy. No, it was the part where the Jets would lose to the Bills. I was certain of this. However, it is the prediction that I made in August, which is really to blame for the Jets departure. It was then that I said: \u201cRex Ryan will lead the Bills to an 8-8 record this year and take them downhill from there.\u201d Next time, I\u2019ll be more careful.", "createDate": "1451881253", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1451882723", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 71185668, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/7118/5668/cropped-71185668.jpg?0.42772284298915497", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17108638", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451882723", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17108638, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
