KC looks and is playing great.  NE is limping into the game, but they're still NE, and the game is on their home field.  I like KC's chances to make it to the Super Bowl anyway, but if they win this game it could give them the confidence to win it all.  NE is so banged up that it will be game by game regardless for them the whole way, but if they win the game they assert their NE-ish ability to get it done no matter what when it counts the most.", "createDate": "1452956798", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452981753", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 45351747, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4535/1747/cropped-45351747.jpg?0.31965004665277413", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17243489", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452981753", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17243489, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
