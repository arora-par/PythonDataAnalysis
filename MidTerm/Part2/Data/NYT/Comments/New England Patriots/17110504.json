But we do know the ugliness of players coming onto the field with baseball bats, the physical strain of an extra game added to the player's schedule and players like Ndamukong Suh who voice threats against quarterbacks and then proceeds onto the field at more than 300 pounds to kick quarterbacks or jump on their ankles but his behaviors are ignored by the zebras, team owners,  coaches and Commissioner Goodell. Desperation is the catalyst to justify the  exorbitant salary for Suh to change dynamics of the best team players competing for the Superbowl. NFL players who are paid big bucks to  harm quarterbacks stretch the credibility of any shred of decency or integrity within the league\u2019s administration. The fans do not want players hurt, nor do we want to see unsportsman behavior. The league just doesn't get it.
