Both want instant<br/>gratification - win now. Both permit the impermanence of a team becoming a part of the community. Losing season? Fire somebody. (It is, after all, the one-percenters who own the teams and their behavior is an example of the disregard for the communities. And the fans agree!) Oakland announced no public money nor land for a new stadium. It's a start. Let the one-percenters spend their own money on their teams. If the team owns the land and the stadium, they'll think more long-term and remain in the community and develop a true following. A losing season or two? Part of the ebb and flow of<br/>athletics. The owners and fans need to grow up. They're in this together.", "createDate": "1451931103", "recommendations": 6, "updateDate": "1451931903", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 37177669, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17113886", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451931903", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17113886, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
