As others have pointed out in the comments, Spygate was also overblown, just as \"Deflategate\" has been. Yet those two incidents are taken as \"evidence\" that the Patriots have cheat, have always cheated, &amp; will always cheat. But the facts demonstrate that that's just not so. As others have pointed out, though, many people never let the facts get in the way of their opinions.", "createDate": "1453583777", "recommendations": 22, "updateDate": "1453584593", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 63322594, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17316347", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453584593", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17316347, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
