If there's a will there may be a way. The motivation? The utter realization that the party almost certainly has nothing to lose and something to gain--not the WH but their party. So many Republicans now know. Trump is a one-trick pony. He will not \"pivot.\" He can't because he has nothing to offer a general electorate. He knows that.

Watch for a coup attempt.", "createDate": "1466296592", "recommendations": 250, "updateDate": "1466330675", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 52588969, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18885881", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1466334275", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18885881, "replyCount": 4, "editorsSelection": true}
