I'm a diehard fan who had season tickets back in the 60's.  What I saw yesterday is different from what you saw.  I saw two mediocre teams with dull offenses.  This was not a case of the Jets losing the game they should have won.  It was a poor team losing to another poor team.  For once, the Bills made fewer mistakes than their opponents--and they won.  To be honest, it looked like two teams playing out the string--the last game of the year.  I was surprised at the Jets lack of emotion because they had something to lose.  There was little emotion on Buffalo's side, even with the Ryan coaching thing the media slavers over.  Fitzpatrick didn't have a great game, but he's not the villain.  This was a Jets team loss, and it was pretty boring regardless which team you might be rooting for.", "createDate": "1451921381", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1451922565", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 52783242, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17111527", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451922565", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17111527, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
