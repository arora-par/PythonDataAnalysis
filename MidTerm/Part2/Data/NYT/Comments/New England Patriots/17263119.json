The rule change involved the taping of signals that every single team in the league does for post game analysis. The question was where the cameras were allowed to be placed. Goodell outlawed placing them on the sidelines rather than the stands. This was not a material difference in this day and age but he made a point of it and Belichick, for whatever reason, saw no sense in the change. He's made reference several times to the fat that what they were taping was \"visible to 80,000 people.\" It was camera placement, not nefarious camera usage. If you know anything about science, you know there was no such thing as an under inflated football at last year's AFCCG. Gotcha journalism in the age of Twitter, driven by craven and cowardly leaks from embittered team and league sources, perpetuated by lazy scribes in need of clicks. Mr. Rhoden, you work for the NYTimes, fact-based context is important. Ask your old colleague Judith Miller about those aluminum tubes in Iraq before you make reference to such things as \"underinflated\" footballs and \"hidden cameras,\" yeah?", "createDate": "1453172184", "recommendations": 12, "updateDate": "1453219205", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 28736514, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17263119", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453219205", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17263119, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
