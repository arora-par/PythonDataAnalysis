He is an outstanding coach and motivator. Time and again in these situations, ownership fails to fess up to the real culprit.... inferior player talent. The clich\u00e9 the coach/manager has to go because you can't replace the team, doesn't hold up in this case. The needs to mostly be replaced!<br/><br/> It is not Coughlin's fault. Just watch these bumblers play a few quarters and it becomes pretty obvious. A few good players, but generally, the PLAYERS STINK and no coach alive can make them anything other.
