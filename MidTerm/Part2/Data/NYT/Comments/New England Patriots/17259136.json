He says all the right things about the Patriots because their success is impossible to ignore, but I laughed when he effectively says \"just because they cheat doesn't mean they aren't talented...\"  Die-hard Patriot fans for whom the team can do no wrong, and people like Rhoden who are convinced that they cheat, don\u2019t want to examine all the facts surrounding the air pressure in those infamous footballs because they want to cling to their beliefs.  Nerd that I am, and initially believing the Great Brady had cheated, I read the Wells report and ALL that followed, like a series of mystery novels.  To my surprise, one critical fact emerged:  in the history of U.S. football no one had ever before tested the air pressure in the balls once they were put in to play or instituted protocols for measuring, recording, and monitoring the air pressure of each ball before, during and after a game in order to distinguish natural changes from possible tampering.  I have no idea what human flaws the Patriots have, but there is no sound basis for concluding that they or anyone else were responsible for changes in air pressure.  There is only \"noise\".", "createDate": "1453128523", "recommendations": 60, "updateDate": "1453128949", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 57997439, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17259136", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453128949", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17259136, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
