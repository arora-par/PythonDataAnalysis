The recent performance of the team has been abysmal, but I do not feel that Coach should continue to suffer for the ineptitude of the team. He does not drop the passes, throw the interceptions, fumble the ball or miss the tackles. Coach deserves to leave on a high note. I remember as a child serenading Ali Sherman with 'Good bye Ali' at the Yale Bowl. He deserved it. Coach Coughlin deserves to ride into the sunset on his terms and enjoy his grandkids full time. It may not be in the teams best interest, but he deserves better. I lieu of getting a better team, I think its time to collect your accolades Coach and call it a career.
