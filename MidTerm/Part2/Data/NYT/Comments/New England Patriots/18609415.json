He's newsworthy.  Not to cover him is a form of censorship.  If this country votes him its leader, it won't be because of the press.  It will be in spite of the press, for there is no doubt Trump's views have been made very clear, in this piece and in others. If Trump is elected, it will be because the electorate wanted him elected.  Good job NYT.  We need more of these articles on Trump - in depth, timely, and so very accurate.
