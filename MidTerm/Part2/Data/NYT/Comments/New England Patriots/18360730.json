Something tells me that if a person of a specific race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other identifiable trait makes a comment they do not agree with, most of these people will make just as harsh a biased comment.  Whether this has anything to do with most of society's general views of women is questionable. The media seems to jump on every such incident as \"proof\" of the greater ills of society.  Certainly female sportscasters, as well as female athletes, have made very significant strides in the past few decades and will continue to do so.  Unfortunately, sports media producers have to cater to their crowd, conscious of advertising dollars and some of that crowd are misogynist, racist, homophobic, prejudice cretins.  It is likely that there will be some barriers based on these perceived economics for a long time to come.
