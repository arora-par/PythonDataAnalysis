Though many fans look no further than the won-lost column, computer rankings and linesmakers tend to go one level deeper, dismissing close losses and rewarding big wins.\"<br/><br/>Carolina never lost by more than 7 points, even in week 2. And of course only lost once not 6 times. Carolina had 3 wins by more than 26 points. They had 6 wins by 14 or more points.<br/>This should be a very competitive game and either team could surely win without it being wildly surprising (as is true with all the games this weekend) but this paragraph in the article was written in a way to suggest that Seattle would be favored by the \"computers and linesmakers\" because of this and that is simply stupid since Carolina is equally suited for the same argument.
