My most vivid memories of him was that he simply refused to be tackled, and both teams knew it.  I can't recall more than a handful of times that he was brought down by one defender.  The vast majority of the time he lumbered on until he was literally carrying three or four guys on his back and stopped moving forward, but was still on his feet.  Enjoy your retirement.  It is well deserved.", "createDate": "1454966153", "recommendations": 7, "updateDate": "1454968333", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 32331399, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17499933", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454968333", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17499933, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
