And I don't think you should feel so bad.  You have a good team.  You went from 4-12 to 10-6.  That's pretty good.  And I  think you and the AFC East are only going to get better next year.<br/><br/>I  have to disagree though that it was Rex Ryan's defensive strategy that won the game for the Bills.  Sure our defense came through in clutch moments in the 4th quarter.  But it was our offense staying on the field and racking up an incredible time of possession that made the difference.  Could that have been Ryan's defensive strategy all along?  Turning common wisdom on its ear, was the best defense a good offense?  Tyrod Taylor made some good plays with his legs.  But he usually holds the ball too long on pass plays.  Yesterday he was getting the ball out quicker on short passes to Sammy Watkins rather than waiting all day for receivers to get open down the field.  That led to a lot of first downs and positive time of possession. <br/><br/>So chin up, Jets fans!  You played hard and you played well.  You'll get 'em next year.  Except for the Bills!", "createDate": "1451929465", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1451932033", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 27363762, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17113490", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451932033", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17113490, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
