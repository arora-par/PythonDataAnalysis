The left is guilty of it at times as well but the way the right goes about to achieving their goals is just dirty. Fortunately, the younger generation of Poland is more secular so the Catholic vote will slowly become more irrelevant. But until the older generation passes they will always cling to this. Similar to how the right clings to Christian values in the U.S. <br/><br/>I just hope we don't have a repeat of this in the U.S. on Tuesday. We've had enough examples of what alt right governments will do when given the chance in European countries lately. Fueled by hate and misunderstanding by people who have been essentially displaced in the economy of today, but also are the people who refuse to change. It's a tougher world out there and I do feel their pain, it's why my family moved to the states, but a refusal to change, move, and adapt is no reason that the rest of us should suffer as a result.", "createDate": "1478203251", "recommendations": 12, "updateDate": "1478206810", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 57733653, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20347172", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1478210410", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20347172, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
