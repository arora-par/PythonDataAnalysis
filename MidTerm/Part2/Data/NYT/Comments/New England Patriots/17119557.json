I worry even more about who the Giants will bring in that will be an improvement over TC?  Even more, if the new coach doesn't keep Bob Mcadoo, then Eli will be learning yet another system...and he probably only has 3 years left in the tank.  It may sound crazy, but Giants should consider trading Eli and gathering picks or young talent to fill their many, many talent gaps.  This rebuild will take a long time, and Eli deserves chance to win and return to superbowl.", "createDate": "1451980258", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1452009517", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 22745631, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17119557", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452009517", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17119557, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
