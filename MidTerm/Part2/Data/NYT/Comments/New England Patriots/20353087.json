The fact that the number of Jews in present-day Poland is very small does not mean that they are not influential, or that they are not overrepresented (proportionately to their numbers) in the media and other politically and economically powerful/important enterprises. Many Poles think that most Jews do not really care about Poland and its national interests -- and there is some truth to that. If anything, comments in the NYT often confirm that.

And yet the poets such as Julian Tuwim, Boleslaw Lesmian, or Krzysztof Baczynski, a science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem, composer Henryk Wieniawski, pianist Arthur Rubinstein, mathematican Hugo Steinhaus, pedagogue Jan Korczak, all are being celebrated by Poland as its proud sons. <br/><br/>Do you still maintain that the Jews do not care about Poland's national interest?
