It hurts to see a once great quarterback decline.<br/><br/>I hope that if he starts the SuperBowl that way they pull him and put Brock Osweiler in.  It would be great to see Peyton perform well and close out his career with a win.<br/><br/>It doesn't look good for Denver no matter which quarterback they use.", "createDate": "1453736999", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1453741948", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 1183390, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17330661", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453741948", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17330661, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
