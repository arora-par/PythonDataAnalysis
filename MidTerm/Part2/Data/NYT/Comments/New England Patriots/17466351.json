Goodell's \"Little Dictator\" act is getting old &amp; tired.  1 suspension for wife/spousal abuse, child abuse.  4  for unproven, likely never happened \"Deflategate\" (per a  Judge, a scientist who studies the field, not to mention the NT Times' own  sports writer).<br/><br/>Though I despised her politics, Condeleeza Rice would be a better commissioner that Rogie, &amp; probably  more honest &amp; fair.  No parties, unless NFL Approved? (does that mean paid off?)  The owner of the only known tape of the 1st Superbowl game not allowed to show it or sell it?  The entire bowl held in Secaucus where it seemed only the rich folks could go (&amp; park).  The late great Teddy Roosevelt would have busted this conglomerate up years ago.<br/><br/>I grew up in NJ/NY.  More a baseball fan (METS!!) but how can this be allowed to go on.  Is Goodell jealous of Brady &amp; now Peyton Manning?  Yet, Manziel &amp; Rice skate free?", "createDate": "1454686855", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1454692466", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 46523316, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17466351", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1454692466", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17466351, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
