Julius Peppers staying \"home\" and not vacating his position to leave Fitzgerald wide open; or 4.) eliminate one of three defensive \"whiffs\" as Fitzgerald romped down field. Your pro-deuce advocacy benefits from hindsight. Botched coin flip and stupid OT rules notwithstanding, GB had a decent chance of winning in OT, certainly better than making a sudden-death, make-it-or-go-home deuce try.", "createDate": "1453226947", "recommendations": 3, "updateDate": "1453227096", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 62374848, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 17270557, "userLocation": "Calgary, AB", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17269327, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "John", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "If you watched the play you would see that that cross field lob was hardly \"dangerous\" - there was nobody within 15 yards of Fitzgerald.     As far as hindsight - I said before the Hail Mary pass was thrown that if Green Bay scores they should go for two.    Green Bay's chances of winning in OT are exactly identical to their chances of scoring a two point conversion...in fact, scoring the deuce might have been a bit higher.  Add to the fact that there's also a 5% chance they miss the kick to tie the game and going for two is a very easy decision.  Especially against a defense that is exhausted and just gave up a 98 yard touchdown drive.   There is no hindsight - I will say it now, in the last second of play, when choosing between going for two, or kicking to go to OT, going for two is the correct decision ALWAYS.", "createDate": "1453232277", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1453233251", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 72993604, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 2, "replies": [], "permID": "17269327:17270557", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453233251", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "userReply", "parentUserDisplayName": "Leopold", "commentID": 17270557, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}, {"commentSequence": 17271830, "userLocation": "Ketchum", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 17269327, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Hemingway", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "Green Bay's defense is prone to the giving up the big play; they have been for a few years now.
