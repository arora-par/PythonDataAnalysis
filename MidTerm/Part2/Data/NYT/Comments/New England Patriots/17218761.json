The increasing prominence of the part of the NFL that is \"just business\" (pitting cities against each other to extract optimal stadium deals, disregard for players' short term and long term health, free agency, salary caps, etc.) exposes an absurdist landscape.  That this happened against a backdrop where it is common to rail against the 1% or \"the elite\" makes this action all the richer.", "createDate": "1452773352", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1452791886", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 57121552, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17218761", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452791886", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17218761, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
