Televised games often run 2 1/2 hours to present the 60 minutes of actual playing time. Commercials, talking heads who inform us of what we've just seen, side-line \"interviews\" which reveal \"what the game is all about\" run interminably. And what exactly is a \"two minute warning?\" I get notices, alarms, beeps, chirps, every day, each of which takes less than a second. But football coaches who watch the clock carefully need a \"warning\" when each half is going to end? Bill Belichick needs a \"warning\"? About what? Oh: commercials. We get a two minute warning to tell us to grab a beer, preferably of the advertised suds.", "createDate": "1453060715", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453060747", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 30466203, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17255035", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453060747", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17255035, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
