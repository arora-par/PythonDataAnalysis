First, Trump ran a campaign that in his own words spewed the most vile racism, sexism and white supremacist lingo.  His supporters loved it - and make no mistake - that is why they voted for him.  Now - everyone from Trump to Bernie Sanders are trying to normalize what we have just witnessed.  And that, according to the great historian Masha Gessen, is how autocrats and fascists rise to power. Do not normalize this.  Steve Bannon is an anti-Semite and a racist.  He has said so in word and deed.  Do not accept this.  Stop using polite euphemisms.  We are in dangerous and scary times.  Had only people taken Hitler or Pol Pot at their words.  The next step according to Ms. Gessen and other historians - is destabilizing the judiciary with an outrageous pick to the Supreme Courts nad other higher courts.  I'm bracing myself for impact.  I count on the paper of record to tell it like it is - in the GOP's own words - and stop pretending we are in an era of intellectualism and rational thinking.
