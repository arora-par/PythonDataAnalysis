Easterbrook's new book about pro football and his observation about too much punting on fourth down. In addition to poor clock management Andy Reid was certainly too timid on fourth down by punting in NE territory. One would think Reid, with a long, successful coaching pedigree, would be a bit bolder on fourth down.<br/><br/>One final note in the Pats game...the Chiefs finally went for it on fourth down in their final possession (they had no choice at that point) and Smith's fourth down pass was \"intercepted\" way downfield at the Pats' 15-yard line. Of course, the pass should never have been intercepted as it cost the Pats over 30 yards in the change of possession. But the Pats were \"saved\" upon further review when the defensive back was ruled to have been out of bounds. Those 30 yards could have made a huge difference.
