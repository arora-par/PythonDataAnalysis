He also isn't interested in social issues like abortion and gay rights (he actually spoke in favor of Planned Parenthood in the debate, albeit rather tepidly). Like Elizabeth Warren, he is opposed to the TPP. Some Democrats will defect to Trump in November over that issue alone.", "createDate": "1456843920", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1456845403", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 74587244, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17746448", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1456845403", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17746448, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
