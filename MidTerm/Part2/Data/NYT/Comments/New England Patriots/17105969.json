Can you imagine a Patriots team that went 19-0? <br/><br/>\"We did time trials - 19 seconds, 20 seconds. I thought he was nuts.\" Nuts, scruts. Genius is in the details. Football is a game of milli-seconds. A coach who isn't timing pass rush routes, field goal durations, QB drop back times, and on and on will quickly earn a new title - insurance agent.<br/><br/>One of his OL said \"some day I can tell my kids that I played for a HOF coach. Who are they going to get to replace him?\"<br/><br/>No matter what happens on Monday, Coach Coughlin has earned a standing ovation. Show your class, New York. Make it long and thunderous.", "createDate": "1451846568", "recommendations": 4, "updateDate": "1451848554", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 52539234, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17105969", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1451848554", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17105969, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
