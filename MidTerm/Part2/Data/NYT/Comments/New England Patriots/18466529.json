The only sport I care about is baseball and the whole flow of the game grinds to a halt when they stop play every five minutes to \"check with New York.\"  While they're at it, why not allow the review of balls and strikes too?  Of course, that'll totally kill the game; but there won't be any blown calls.  On second thought, why not eliminate the umps altogether and have cameras and computers make the calls? The old system was imperfect; but it was better than what we have now or are likely to have in the future.", "createDate": "1462737956", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1462741246", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 49260903, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18466529", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462744846", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18466529, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
