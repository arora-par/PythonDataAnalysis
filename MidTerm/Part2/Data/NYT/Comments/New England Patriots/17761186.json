I was wondering why Trump did so well in Massachusetts. Interesting too is the Milwaukee Journal's suggestion that Trump is a caricature of East Coast attitudes and bad behavior that grates on Midwestern sensibilities. That rings true to me; I know NO ONE in the St. Louis area who supports Trump. I live in relatively affluent suburbs and know lots of Republicans, who are all horrified.
