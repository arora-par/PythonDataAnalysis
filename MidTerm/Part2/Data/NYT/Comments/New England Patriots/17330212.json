Incredible. Also, the bizarre strategy by the Broncos to sit on a one score lead and let their D try to hold it almost cost them the game. If they try that against Carolina the rout will only be worse. But a one-sided rout is what we are about to see, unless Manning figures it out in time. He's got to get the ball out quick. Then running game has to be stuck with. They have to score points. And the D will need to be even better. Then maybe we'll have a game.", "createDate": "1453735724", "recommendations": 2, "updateDate": "1453741948", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 46622048, "picURL": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17330212", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453741948", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17330212, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
