Three problems. (1) too many things get reviewed (2) the reviews take way, way too long and (3) at least a third of the time they still get the call wrong after review.  The article notes referee tendencies.  Who is tracking tendencies of replay refs to affirm or overturn?  Now THESE guys make the bad call that ruins the game.  And college seems even worse.  More replays and more mistakes.", "createDate": "1462653970", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1462673953", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 21489368, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18457536", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1462677553", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18457536, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
