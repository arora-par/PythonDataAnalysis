Do they really pay you to do this?  Manning the field general may have been OK but Manning the athlete was awful. They won in spite of him, not in any sense because of him. I didn't count, but at least four or five times he ruined offensive drives by allowing himself to get sacked (while the more nimble and focused Brady almost always unloaded the ball into the ground or the sideline). And Manning's passes were like clay pigeons tossed up for quail hunting practice. They floated, they wobbled, they took too long to get to his receivers.  He ran for one first down, he somehow threw two touchdowns (but missed open receivers with regularity), but compared to the other quarterbacks in the playoffs, even the atrocious effort by Carson Palmer, Manning looked the most out of place, hardly being able to move or throw on the level we expect for an NFL QB, even a backup. Unless Carolina is filling its battered roster from the practice squad, the Panthers will demolish Manning and likely run up a score that will embarrass the Broncos in Super Bowl 50.", "createDate": "1453748753", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1453753082", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 43316769, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17334329", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453753082", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17334329, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
