As for all the Patriot drama, it's not helping. That said, no team I can think of in NFL history has been so incredibly resilient. To people like Belichick and Brady ending the season 2-4 is meaningless. They know how to win football games when they have to. Andy Reid's had a magical season and I'm happy for him, but he hasn't played the Patriots, in Foxborough, in a playoff game. It should be a great game.", "createDate": "1452963104", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1452981887", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 72305139, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17244622", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1452981887", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17244622, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
