Today\u2019s Donald Trump will be the Donald Sterling of the 2020\u2019s and the Sumner Redstone (whom he uncannily resembles) of the 2030\u2019s, if he lasts that long. As for Trump\u2019s PR men and spin doctors, they remind me of nothing so much as O.J. Simpson\u2019s dream team. Whether or not they actually believe in their man, they know a good deal when they see one.", "createDate": "1463926345", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1463948849", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 65458987, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18605070", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1463952449", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18605070, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
