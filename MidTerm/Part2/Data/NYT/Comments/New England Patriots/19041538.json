Pushing to get bragging rights for 73 wins, tauntingly saying LeBron's feelings were hurt, acting like it was over after the first two games of the championship series, bemoaning the officials - swagger is one thing, confidence another, but hubris - well, let's see if they continue to act like anointed champions before the first whistle of the season has even blown. If they do, it wouldn't surprise me to see them fall again, even with a great player like KD on the floor. <br/><br/>And Durant, great as he is, has never beaten LeBron nor risen to the ultimate challenge when it mattered most, and the Warriors' ring came against an injury depleted opponent. Maybe Curry was hurt in the finals, but he wasn't even the best player on his own team, let alone the league, in June. If LeBron had wilted like that in the finals we'd never hear the end of it.", "createDate": "1467689855", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1467714743", "commentTitle": "n/a", "userID": 50129921, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [{"commentSequence": 19047111, "userLocation": "Page, AZ", "userTitle": "NULL", "parentID": 19041538, "sharing": 0, "userDisplayName": "Lou Good", "status": "approved", "userURL": "NULL", "commentBody": "LBJ is on your team and you talk about hubris?!<br/><br/>Name one other person in ANY sport EVER who constantly feels the need to state, \"I am the best player on the planet.\"  Clock is ticking...<br/><br/>Go ahead, put your shirt on while you think about it.<br/><br/>The comments from Cleveland?
