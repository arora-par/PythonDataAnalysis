The playcalling just wasnt there. Lacy looked a step slow, Starks looked a bit fumbly, and Rodgers (while a great scrambling QB) is sub-par on QB sneaks. I think they made the right call with Crosby. <br/><br/>The real question Packers fans should be asking is why they're paying Shields all that money. He had arguably his worst game/season as a packer. Dropping one sure INT, another possible INT, and methinks he was the main culprit on the blown coverage of Fitz (not to mention missing a tackle on him downfield on the same overtime play).", "createDate": "1453243259", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1453254231", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 55411314, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17272397", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453254231", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17272397, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
