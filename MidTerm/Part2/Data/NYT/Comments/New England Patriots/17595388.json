The highest paid college employee is neither a University President or a football coach.  It is the manager of investments for Harvard's endowment.  The exorbitant payment to football people  is based on a universal principle.  If Goodell generates income he's paid for that.  If Harvard's endowment grows. its manager is paid for that.  Those who generate big money are paid lucrative salaries.  Football is not unique in this regard.", "createDate": "1455695485", "recommendations": 1, "updateDate": "1455725424", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 48147869, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/4814/7869/cropped-48147869.jpg?1475980521793890914", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17595388", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1455725424", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17595388, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
