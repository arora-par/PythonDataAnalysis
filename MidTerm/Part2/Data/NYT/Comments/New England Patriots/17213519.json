It is not sport and yet somehow people buy tickets and jerseys and commit themselves emotionally to these random franchises. How gullible and desperate does one have to be to give any kind of loyalty to a team that represents nothing apart from the NFL and its business model. Put a city's name in front of some hyperbolic/childish title (e.g. Warriors, Jets, Raiders, Kings) and the locals will come running with their money. Madness.
