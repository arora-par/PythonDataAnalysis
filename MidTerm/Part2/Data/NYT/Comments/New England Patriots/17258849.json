No, Mr. Rhoden, neither the Patriots nor anyone else deflated those footballs. The disparity was a result of atmospheric conditions, uncalibrated gauges, and differential treatment of the two teams' balls during the halftime measuring process. 'Deflategate' is not a symbol of anything at all, other than the antipathy and envy so many hold for the most successful coach, quarterback, team, and organization in football.", "createDate": "1453126524", "recommendations": 41, "updateDate": "1453126862", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 28186428, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17258849", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453126862", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17258849, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
