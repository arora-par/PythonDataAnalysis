The liberals ignore and say nothing about Trump's decisions that are not half-bad, then wait for the decisions they despise and pounce on them, stating the end of the world is nigh. The conservatives counter, call all liberal ideas crazy and politically correct, and bring up only those occurrences that confirm their own belief systems. Beliefs should be in the service of hard data and not the other way around, regardless of your political leanings, ethnicity, or gender. If you read this far you probably already know this and if you stopped reading many words ago, then the message was basically 'returned to sender.'
