Maybe the moral and ethical standards of Mr. Bannon are not that repugnant in the end, like Trump who has said some unfortunate things, as has everyone, that he regrets? If political correctness gets pushed to the maximum, business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing.  How many lives have to be ruined by such enforced \"correctness\"?  And what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like Soros, who will hold them to account?", "createDate": "1479164989", "recommendations": 108, "updateDate": "1479221322", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 72254614, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "20484192", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1479165946", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 20484192, "replyCount": 95, "editorsSelection": true}
