It seems like the top NBA teams are confronted with the choice of playing for the championship or playing for best won-loss record.  In the past, Gregg Popovich rested Tim Duncan during the regular season, only to have the Spurs roar on to the championship.  Many years ago, the Boston Celtics led by an elderly Bill Russell finished fourth, but won an NBA championship with players that had a lot left for the playoffs.  <br/><br/>The same has happened this year in the world of European soccer, where FC Barcelona, loaded with galacticos but worn down by simultaneous play in La Liga, Copa del Rey and the Champions League, plus national team duty for many players, was unable to prevail in the Champions League.<br/><br/>The message here is clear.  If players are overworked, the best you can hope for are tired players.  Worst case, some players break down with injuries.<br/><br/>The less than stellar playoff performance by the Warriors should not be a surprise.", "createDate": "1464370153", "recommendations": 0, "updateDate": "1464395024", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 67823893, "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "18666410", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1464398624", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 18666410, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
