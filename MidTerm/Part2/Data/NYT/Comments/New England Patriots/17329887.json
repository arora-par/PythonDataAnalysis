Say what you want about Peyton, his arm, age, lack of mobility (how about those nifty clutch runs!) etc., he finally had a defense playing on his side and not across the line of scrimmage; he never had this in Indy and goodness knows what he would have done with the type of talent surrounding him that Brady ahs enjoyed most of his career. I hope Peyton goes out the way his boss did... a pretty good quarterback in his own right, maybe the best of his generation. Thanks for a fitting last paragraph which pretty much sums it up.", "createDate": "1453734711", "recommendations": 11, "updateDate": "1453736215", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "userID": 62766974, "picURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6276/6974/cropped-62766974.jpg?0.5176322121166395", "depth": 1, "replies": [], "permID": "17329887", "recommendedFlag": null, "timespeople": 1, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "approveDate": "1453736215", "trusted": 0, "commentType": "comment", "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentID": 17329887, "replyCount": 0, "editorsSelection": false}
